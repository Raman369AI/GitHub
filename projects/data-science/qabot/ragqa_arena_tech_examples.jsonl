{"question": "how does changing your password every 90 days increase security?", "response": "The necessity of password changes depends on the context and what is being protected.  \nThey are not a comprehensive solution and negatively impact usability but could make sense in certain scenarios.  \nThey do address issues that could arise if an attacker obtained password hashes and limit the damage if an old backup is lost.  \nWithout password expiry, there is potentially an unlimited time window for attackers to attempt dictionary, brute-force, or common password attacks.  \nExpiration policies can help prevent issues for people who reuse passwords across different systems.  \nIt forces the user to come in contact with a possibly inactive account; they may not know whether their account has been breached otherwise.  \nPassword resets can signal to users the importance of password security.  \nAutomatic expiration can also safeguard against non-compliance and may provide a limited time for attackers to break a password before it becomes invalid.  \nSome argue that if strong passwords are used, frequent changes are less necessary.  \nOthers say that it is mainly a compliance-driven requirement with marginal security benefits, and is not something you should rely on for security. \nRecently, NIST's new guidelines recommend against \"expiration without reason\". \nSome maintain that password expiration policies are considered bothersome to users, are ineffective in mitigating brute-force attacks because only in an intermediate, balanced scenario would a password change make any difference.  \nFurther, changing passwords could be seen as increasing the security risk through use of post-it notes, increasing numbers or shift-numbers for ordinary users. \nA study by Microsoft found that forcing users to change their password every six months isn't very useful: at least 41% of passwords can be broken offline from previous passwords for the same accounts in a matter of seconds, and five online password guesses in expectation suffices to break 17% of accounts, concluding that the evidence suggests it may be appropriate to do away with password expiration altogether.", "gold_doc_ids": [2172, 2173, 2174, 2175, 2176, 2177, 2178, 2180, 2218, 2241, 2479, 3094, 3393, 7062, 7319, 261, 617, 1794, 5369, 6538, 6759]}

{"question": "why is global state so evil?", "response": "Bugs, poor testability, impure functions, code understanding difficulties, concurrency concerns, and potential performance hits are some of the notable issues associated with mutable global state. \nGlobal state can lead to unpredictable program behavior since it may be altered from unknown locations within the application, affecting the reliability of method outputs and the ability to unit test them effectively.  \nGlobal variables are also considered unreliable given that any part of the code could modify their state, which complicates debugging efforts when functions exhibit inconsistent behavior. \nMoreover, if an application utilizes global variables widely, removing or altering them requires extensive changes throughout the code, resulting in significant maintenance challenges. \nGlobals foster complex dependencies and hinder the ability to maintain program invariants, which are crucial for ensuring application integrity. \nThe utilization of global state also diminishes code readability as dependencies are not obvious and need to be traced, further complicating the maintenance process.  \nMoreover, managing globals, especially when used excessively, is difficult and prone to issues which escalate with the size of the application.  \nConsider that what may start as one global folder path may become one of several or even hundreds in the future which could make restructuring a nightmare especially if, say, two databases are required. \nAlso, the bigger the global state, the more difficult writing automated tests becomes, because all tests must work with the same global configuration value. \nSpecifically, the use of singletons in programming creates challenges for unit testing due to potential contamination of global state and imposes rigid constraints when flexibility is required. \nGlobal state variables also pose problems for the user, because considering more than a few parameters to understand their combined impact on a program's functionality is a typical limitation of human cognitive abilities. \nProgramming languages designed for secure and robust systems often eliminate global mutable state to simplify reasoning about code and verify system properties more effectively.", "gold_doc_ids": [4606, 4607, 4608, 4609, 4611, 4613, 4614, 4616, 4624, 4629, 4694, 3911]}

{"question": "if immutable objects are good, why do people keep creating mutable objects?", "response": "It depends on your preference, and on what you want to achieve. \nMutability is often chosen for its convenience, as it simplifies the process of updating in place, particularly when dealing with large projects.  \nRepresenting game characters with mutable objects not only enhances game performance significantly but also aligns with our inevitable perception of the real world, which is inherently based on mutable objects.  \nMoreover, certain data structures are notably easier to implement using mutable objects.  \nSome functionalities become challenging with immutable objects, such as bidirectional relationships.  \nWithout mutable objects you have no state, so non-thread-safe, mutable objects are fine if you are not using multiple threads.  \nHowever, in single-threaded scenarios, mutable objects can be perfectly acceptable.  \nThe default mutability in imperative languages, exemplified by Java Beans relying on a specific style of mutating objects, further contributes to the prevalent use of mutable objects. \nFrameworks like Hibernate and JPA essentially dictate the use of mutable objects, emphasizing the ease of development they bring, which often outweighs the advantages of immutable objects in many projects.  \nThe ease of setting multiple values after object instantiation makes mutable objects useful in scenarios where a substantial amount of state needs to be assigned to an object.  \nAlso, if you need to change the object after creation then a mutable Person object will be better. \nHaving the state of an object be mutable makes it possible to have the identity of the object which encapsulates that state be immutable; many programs are designed to model real-world things which are inherently mutable. \nAdditionally, the prevalence of mutable components in essential computer building blocks, such as CPUs, RAM, cache, and disks, reinforces the widespread use of mutable objects in programming.  \nImmutability allows for substantial compiler optimizations due to the guarantee that data will not change, often leading to performance benefits and a reduction in state-related bugs. \nYet, mutable objects remain prevalent, possibly because developers are still blending object-oriented programming with imperative procedural programming. \nFurthermore, mainstream languages do not support immutability well, possibly deterring developers from adopting it unless they switch to more modern languages that naturally accommodate immutability.", "gold_doc_ids": [5035, 5038, 5039, 5041, 5043, 5046, 5049, 5052, 5887, 5896, 5987, 6295, 988, 2162, 4236, 5594]}

{"question": "why are salted hashes more secure for password storage?", "response": "The salt is added before the hash, making the hash completely different for every salt.  \nThis enhances security because when multiple users have the same password, they will have different hashes.  \nA large number of iterations in password hashing algorithms like PBKDF2 or Scrypt is to deliberately slow down attackers, which reduces the key space they can explore in a given time frame. \nSimply salting MD5 hashes isn't sufficient in today's security environment; instead, one should use well-established security options like crypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2, or scrypt, which involve multiple rounds of hashing. \nSalting prevents the cracking of multiple accounts with the same weak password and makes it hard for attackers to identify which passwords are easy to compromise.  \nA salted hash defeats rainbow table attacks because it makes the required rainbow table impractically large.  \nUnique salts per password hash compel attackers to target each password individually, preventing a wide-scale breach, as even similar passwords contain completely different hashes.  \nBy a factor of 2N, the storage requirement and the time to compute a rainbow table are increased by a salt. \nThe presence of salt in password hashing adds a layer of protection against rainbow table attacks by requiring attackers to resort to brute-force methods. \nWhile salts enhance security for medium-strength passwords, their effectiveness depends on the compromise of password hashes, which is already a severe security breach. \nThe primary benefit is evident when users reuse passwords across different systems, making medium-security passwords harder to reverse. \nEven a moderately secure password, when coupled with a salt, can withstand extended brute-force attacks, providing users with an opportunity to change compromised passwords and enhance overall security.", "gold_doc_ids": [7672, 7677, 7678, 7680, 7683, 7685, 7710, 267]}

{"question": "why isnt java used for modern web application development?", "response": "Java is generally considered overkill for small web applications, typically being more suitable for larger systems such as those used by banks and insurance companies.  \nIt is easier to find hosting for PHP compared to Java or ASP, which isn't a flaw of the languages but rather a reflection of market availability. \nJava web applications are not typically associated with rapid development due to their structure and the arduous process of debugging and implementing a business logic layer.  \nStartups need to launch quickly, contradicted by the six-month timeline often required to release a Java web application, and the development process in Java is not as productive compared to frameworks like Rails/Django/Grails. \nJava's earlier presence in web browsers through applets, which performed poorly and had security issues, has negatively impacted its perception in web development. \nJava has the stigma of being unfun and too enterprise-oriented for the needs of startups, which prioritizes a rapid development cycle and the ability to make quick iterative changes.  \nIn terms of cost and work involved, Java usually demands more effort and financial resources, and there's a perceived lack of synergy between the operating system and Java. \nStartups may choose other technologies over Java because they are deemed \"sexier\" with a stronger open source community driving them.  \nJava doesn't have the \"sexy\" appeal of languages like Ruby for many modern web developers, often leading to a preference for languages that promise faster and easier development cycles. \nJava web development frames can be difficult to learn, often unreasonable for the requirements, and the layer of abstraction can be painful to work with.  \nStartups, particularly those driven by under-30 visionaries, favor languages that allow them to program quickly and affordably, and they often choose non-mainstream languages as a natural filter for less committed developers.  \nJava is seen as complicated, with developers finding it easier and quicker to make changes in PHP compared to the restarts often required for Java applications, and the cost of hosting Java applications is also a concern.  \nFramework-based systems like Ruby on Rails provide an easier learning curve and faster setup than Java, which requires learning the language and additional frameworks or tools.  \nJava's syntax is criticized as too verbose and the development process is seen as cumbersome, especially when compared to the simplicity of other languages and frameworks.  \nThe issue with Java in startups is about the trade-off between speed and scalability; startups need to move fast and iterate, which can be done more effectively with simpler languages and frameworks.  \nJava is seen as requiring a medium-sized team to see efficient implementation results, and the options in Java's ecosystem can be overwhelming, coupled with a lack of proper web hosting solutions.  \nJava is verbose and the community is seen as less innovative, with developers gravitating towards languages like Ruby, Python, or PHP, which are seen as more \"friendly\" and \"fun\".  \nTo differentiate from the masses, developers learn new languages as Java is seen as the language of everyone, with other languages being more connected to modern web development.  \nJava is complex to learn and its ecosystem can be overwhelming, especially for beginners, whereas properly configured Java environments can be highly productive.  \nJava and J2EE may have been associated with long development cycles and heaviness, and alternatives in other languages are seen as offering a unified solution rather than a multitude of options.  \nJava is associated with a slower development time compared to languages like Python, and in web frameworks, Java's heavy resource requirements and lack of good shared hosting options are disadvantages.  \nThe complexity often found in Java applications is seen as a result of the mindset of some developers within the Java community.  \nJava's verbosity and lack of certain modern language features can make development frustrating in comparison to dynamic languages that offer faster iterations in web development.  The \"cool kids\" in the developer community may use languages like Ruby because they solve problems in still simpler and time- and effort-saving ways, leaving Java due to its perceived difficulty and annoyance.  \nJava's lack of multiline string support and unsatisfactory web frameworks contribute to a challenging environment for creating web applications.  \nJava can be used efficiently and \"hackily\" to quickly build systems, but the inclination to overcomplicate projects can result from the extensive knowledge and tools available within the Java ecosystem.", "gold_doc_ids": [7918, 7919, 7922, 7924, 7925, 7927, 7928, 7931, 7936, 7937, 7938, 7939, 8070, 8079, 5092, 5093, 5094, 5096, 5097, 5098, 5099, 5100, 5101, 5103, 5124, 5125]}

{"question": "why do we need private variables?", "response": "Private variables are a core principle in programming to ensure the integrity and state of an object are maintained by preventing external alterations.  \nThey also discourage reliance on specific aspects of the code that may change.  \nBy managing complexity and limiting access to a class's internals, private variables ensure that potential bugs are isolated to specific sections (usually one source file), making troubleshooting far more efficient. \nAnother advantage is related to the concept of 'coupling'. \nEncapsulation, which makes the external interface of the class explicit, and is fundamental concept of object-oriented programming, leverages private variables to ensure that the corresponding variable remains in the defining class only. \nIn essence, private variables ensure that later references outside the scope of an object or function won't inadvertently affect other variables.  \nThey also make it easier to expand code in the future, without relying on heavy documentation as to what the many public variables do. \nThere's less of a threat of accidentally breaking functionality if fewer variables can be overwritten. \nVariable scope allows you to show consumers of your code what they can and cannot alter.  \nA person wanting to change the code would have to work very hard and have really high runtime permissions in order to change it. \nEncapsulation goes beyond mere discretion; it's about not overloading the user of the class with unnecessary details, and facilitating autonomous changes to a class without affecting other classes that may rely on it. \nIncreased encapsulation results in cleaner, more reliable code by reducing the interdependence of different code parts. \nFurthermore, opting for private over public variables helps guide the design mindset from the get-go, prompting careful consideration of how class internals are exposed to users, leading to more thoughtful API creation. \nIt's important to recognize which aspects of a class are core functionality and which are meant for interaction with external code.  \nLastly, private variables are good to avoid misuse leading the object into an inconsistent status, hard-to-track bugs, and unforeseen exceptions and are also excellent for protected fields.", "gold_doc_ids": [4154, 4155, 4156, 4157, 4159, 4168, 4170, 4172, 4174, 4282, 1026]}

{"question": "how can i deal with the cargo-cult programming attitude?", "response": "You need to find ways to motivate your students, no student that is truly motivated is going to just go for a copy and paste solution. \nThis could be done by challenging them to create the shortest possible solutions to the problem and rewarding the more succinct solutions with an incentive. \nFurthermore, you should instruct with personal involvement, sharing experiences and knowledge, and demand the same depth of engagement from your students. \nYou also need to prove to them that it is both possible and faster to start anew vs. copying and pasting. \nThis could be done by creating new programs before their eyes during class and setting assignments that require creativity, while also adding a factor into the grading of assignments based on conciseness, which could equate to keeping redundant code to a minimum. \nFor example, you should be present them with exercises that build on one another and showcase a different angle to an issue, exposing a previous solution's limitations and prompting a revised approach. \nThis will make them think about, analyze, modify and experiment with each solution, instead of just copy-pasting a ready-made piece of code. \nAs part of this you can have them take the code from previous assignments and turn it into a subroutine.  \nYou will also want to teach them about function documentation to help them understand what the subroutine is actually doing. \nWhen it comes to setting assignments, you should definitely avoid recycling assignments or merely giving them similar sounding ones. \nHowever, you can craft some exercises that might look similar, but aren't, in order to show them how harmful a copy-paste attitude can be; at least to the students that fall into the trap.  \nAdditionally, embracing collaborative problem-solving through discussion and debate would also help.  \nThis would also show them that programming should be about solving the problem at hand and not just finding the quickest fix. \nTo get them thinking, you should ask them ask them detailed questions about snippets of code, before they even start coding. \nAnother way to encourage independent thought, would be to give them assignments where they have to explain the code that someone else wrote, or even refactor it. \nAs part of this they should add comments to the code, line by line if necessary, to explain it in plain English. \nThen, once they have explained the code, they can move on to modifying it. \nIntroducing them to Test-Driven Development (TDD) from the start is another strategy.  \nThis will drive them to actually write more code and test it, which will aid in articulating the problem that they're tackling.  \nAnother method to help move away from the cargo-cult attitude would be to utilize an obscure programming language as to decrease the likelihood of finding pre-written code, thereby requiring them to authentically engage with the programming process. \nFurthermore, consider using a very high-level language that requires a minimum of boilerplate code.  \nYou can also streamline your teaching, by ignoring any concepts that might be counter-productive and focus on the simple idea that computers can only do a very small number of different basic operations. \nMoreover, before even getting on to code, you might want to focus on abstract concepts, thus allowing for a focus on the fundamentals without intimidating students with actual code. \nThis could be a very hands-on activity where you are in charge of guiding them through.  \nBy starting with abstractions and progressing towards the concrete, students are compelled to grasp foundational concepts which are resistant to copy-pasting tactics.  \nAlso, beginning by doing assignments on paper using a pseudo code while adding structures as you see fit can also help. \nFurthermore, denying Internet access during assignments executed in the classroom ensures reliance on core knowledge rather than online resources.  \nAs an introductory exercise, before even writing any code, get your students to submit a printed out algorithm in English adding plenty of comments to it. \nAs part of this they should need to keep translating back and forth between English and a programming language, Java say, this increasing their understanding of code.   \nAnother method which could reduce the intimidation of code that can lead students to resort to a copy-paste strategy is to supply them with some simple code scaffolding that they can easily build upon, which is actually quite normal in the real world of programming. \nAlso, providing incomplete code fragments in tutorials might compel learners to thoroughly understand each piece before assembling a functioning program. \nAs part of the learning process, repetition is key and will help them to eventually go from imitation to mastery, even just typing out the code can help get to a place of understanding it. \nFurthermore, dedicating time with problem students to work on elementary constructs and straightforward routines may help them apprehend the essential basics and you also might consider having them learn flow charting.  \nTo progress students through the stages of learning, choose diversified problems, and projects that develop over time, encourage peer reviews, and have them write extensive documentation on their code.  \nYou want to build their skills to get them to a place where you can encourage them to engage in self-driven projects on topics of personal interest.  \nFinally, animation projects might help increase the depth of their understanding, as these require comprehension of code execution.", "gold_doc_ids": [1679, 1683, 1685, 1686, 1687, 1688, 1689, 1690, 1691, 1692, 1693, 1695, 1696, 1699, 1700, 1701, 1702, 1703, 1705, 1709, 1710, 1711, 1726, 1731, 1775, 1779, 1807, 2358]}

{"question": "what is the difference between link local and unique local?", "response": "Well-formed answer\n-------------------\n\nIPv6 link-local addresses are obligatory and non-routable, restricted to a single link which has a uniform link-local network.  These addresses function for single-link operations such as automatic configuration and neighbor discovery, and routers are prohibited from forwarding packets with these addresses across different links.  On the contrary, unique local addresses (ULAs), while similar to IPv4's private addresses, are routable within certain local scopes but not on the global internet.  Initially, a part of the ULA space was reserved for centralized allocation to ensure uniqueness, but this has not transpired, resulting in their reservation status.  The other half of the ULA block is left to probabilistic uniqueness, where sites pick /48 prefixes from within this space in a pseudo-random manner. \n\nUnfaithful answer with Insertions\n---------------------------------\n\nIPv6 link-local addresses are a required and non-routable subset of IP addresses that are only valid on a single link, thus they cannot be forwarded beyond their designated link.  Unique local addresses (ULAs) are analogous to IPv4's RFC1918 addresses and can be routed within a private network or between a collective of sites, but like link-local addresses, ULAs are not for internet advertising.  The reservation of a portion of the ULA space due to a lack of centralized allocation means some ULAs are reserved, while others are intended for local use and picked pseudo-randomly to avoid address collisions, a system designed to mitigate issues encountered with IPv4 private addressing when interconnecting separate private networks. \n\nUnfaithful answer with Substitution\n-----------------------------------\n\nIPv6 link-local addresses have to exist on all devices and are confined to the scope of a single link\u2014they do not traverse across multiple links.  ULAs are designed for intra-site or certain inter-site routing and bear resemblance to IPv4's RFC1918, providing a solution for local communications without the possibility of global internet routing.  With one segment of the ULA range being officially reserved and unused due to an absence of central allocation, and another allocated for pseudo-random, likely unique local usage, ULAs serve to circumvent the address conflicts often observed with IPv4's private network interconnections.", "gold_doc_ids": [1083, 1084]}
