I have represented council on many matters as the delegated senior local government officer to mediate planning and development court appeals. This has involved significant negotiation with external parties in order to reach suitable agreements. This included matters such as the Pinnacles Development (an out of sequence urban development) and the Weststate Private Hospital (submitter appeal); I have also represented council on complex planning matters including negotiating significant infrastructure agreements for major developments.I have continued to provide a high level of customer service to our key stakeholders, and further provided support and mentoring to senior staff to continue to provide a high level of service.&nbsp;","In relation to my strengths, I consider these include:-&nbsp;&nbsp;* have a calm and measured approach to complex and stressful issues, which assists with team culture.* significant experience in the planning and development sector across multiple areas which allows me to make balanced decisions.&nbsp;* Listen to issues, provide accountability and responsibly to staff, to ensure I empower staff to make decisions.* Have the customer interests at the heart of my decisions and overall service to the community, which&nbsp;includes striving to provide a high level of service.* developed&nbsp;a good professional relationship with staff, including coaching and mentoring where required.&nbsp;&nbsp;","OVERALL PROFESSIONAL GOALS&nbsp;* Improve the overall customer experience and business improvements to be a&nbsp;leader in QLD in relation to planning and development services.&nbsp;* Implement mobility in the workplace and move to full&nbsp;electronic lodgement / assessment and approval&nbsp;across the entire team.&nbsp;* Continue to create a positive team culture that has the shared vision to deliver these outcomes.&nbsp;* Continue to strive to reduce development assessment timeframes to meet the customer service commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;SKILL DEVELOPMENT&nbsp;* Opportunities to act in the Chief Planning and Development Officer role, when the opportunity arises, to continue to broaden my skills and and variety of work tasks.&nbsp;*Have opportunities with secondment roles&nbsp;as they arise to continue to enhance skills and have different skills and learnings.&nbsp; This is not an immediate need, but something for consideration into the future.&nbsp;* Opportunities to work on different projects and initiatives, which sometimes don&#39;t directly align with development assessment, but align with my multi-discipline experience in council.&nbsp; &nbsp;A good example in&nbsp;my current role is leading the CBD property conversion study.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could also be other projects in the City Growth space into the future (i.e. key place making projects or other strategic land use projects).&nbsp;* Opportunity from time to time, to have some flexibility to work from home (i.e. one day a fortnight, where this works for the organisation and the employee).&nbsp;&nbsp;* Continue to work on improving customer service and business improvement projects for the department, as part of the current project, and also sub-projects that may be identified.&nbsp;","Develop/ expand in current role, Secondment opportunities","1.

As a member of the Library Leadership Team and working with HSRs, I have contributed to the achievement of an improved safety culture in the library through:&middot; Improvement in safety measures&middot; additional awareness and actioning of safety related matters&middot; ongoing revision of processes and procedures&middot; rolling out of initiatives such as the Conditions of Entry&nbsp;In 2022, a new Collections Team came together.

Together they will go far, and I am proud to have brought them together.. &nbsp;In 2021 I was given the opportunity to act as Team Manager of Libraries for 6 months, This was during a time of internal turmoil within the library. During this time, I brought stability and consistency to the library service and I have received feedbackfrom colleagues that the library team felt more calm during this time. &nbsp;In 2020, a change to library hours was mooted. This discussion has been ongoing since then, moving from reducing hours because of COVID to increasing them substantially and trialling shopping centre hours to determine the needs and wants of the community. In the leadup, I provided many versions of rosters and costings to support each model of hours suggested by CEL Leadership, culminating in the current offering. I lead the roll-out of the extended hours, working with the different teams across the library and Council, including marketing and safety. The trial is now underway, and requires me to work closely with our front facing team to understand their challenges, as well as removing any barriers so that they can work effectively, efficiently and with the community in focus.","More than 30 years of organisational knowledge of Townsville Library Service.

The primary areas where I believe I have done well / achieved improvements aligned to my role include;- audit unit development &ndash; I have been involved in the development of all Internal Audit and Audit Committee governance documents at Council at varying levels (i.e. drafting, reviewing, providing technical advice based on legislative and professional body better practice advice) depending on the circumstances at the time (i.e. initial setup of documents, conversion of documents at amalgamation of the new TCC, updating for the 2017 reduction process). I have implemented a QA process for IA and aligned Council with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) external quality assessment (EQA) process. The IA Unit has achieved a pass rating for all 3 EQA&rsquo;s which examine approximately 50 principles and standards and are conducted every 5 years in accordance with the IIA framework for professional auditing. This provides Executive Management and Audit Committee members with assurance that Internal Audit is functioning effectively and in alignment with the world largest professional Internal Auditing body&rsquo;s standards. Members of the IA unit are encouraged to be members of the IIA and seek to obtain professional qualifications as Certified Internal Auditors (CIA) and Certification in Risk Management Assurance (CRMA) which are both 18-month examination-based courses. I have achieved both qualifications early in my time at Council. - risk management &ndash; I hold a CRMA (Certification in Risk Management Assurance) from the Institute of Internal Auditors providing significant insight into how risk management works and can be linked to assurance such as that provided by Internal Audit. The CRMA highlights that I am not only qualified to undertake risk management but also to audit others that provide risk management. I was briefly at one stage Councils Internal Audit and Risk Manager until the roles were correctly split at amalgamation. I have always championed risk management and challenged risk management processes at various stages, however it is always a management decision on direction for risk. I have undertaken consulting work in risk including providing risks for fraud after the QAO advised management that Councils fraud risk management was at too high a level to be useful in effective risk management. This project started with approximately 10 fraud risks and finished with approximately 40 fraud risks which were provided to management as a baseline for Councils fraud risk management. This avoided the QAO&rsquo;s ongoing attention and for those areas of Council that took the information provided seriously, it provided a decent start to better managing their fraud risks. Risk management being at too high a level is now a familiar theme for strategic and operational risks and forms part of the KPMG GRC review.- disaster management &ndash; disaster management as Council currently knows it didn&rsquo;t exist when I commenced at council (i.e. there was no local disaster management group with plans and a local disaster coordination centre, let alone a Cat 5 rated LDCC, no Council wide ER or BCP). I was requested (early in my time at Council) by the lead engineer for disaster management (Al Morris) with trying to gain buy in to the process and to get Council to take seriously the new (at that time) Disaster Management Act 2003. This was supported by the regional Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) officer (Wayne Preedy -now Councils Local Disaster Coordinator). Allen worked for a number years slowly gaining improvements and raising more peoples awareness of the risks and gaining better facilities, plans, procedures and exercises to test awareness. Wayne continues this work to this day. Internal Audit assisted by raising awareness through reports into disaster management, ER, BCP and attending key meetings (to support good risk management and assurance around disaster management). A number of competing agenda&rsquo;s needed to be resolved to bring together the framework and what Council has today to be able to understand the roles of the TLDMG and how this integrates with Emergency Response, Business Continuity planning and elements such as building evacuation plans. I am exceptionally proud of where Council now is for disaster management and the part IA has played in what we have today, with a Mayor / Council and Executive who have great buy in and they drive this work onwards leaving IA to work on just tidying up bits and pieces to assist in keeping things on track (i.e. highlighting new advances to consider, keeping training, records and plans in order with health check audits)- guidance document management &ndash; almost every audit starts with what guidance (i.e. policy, administrative directives, corporate and departmental procedures) exists and is the guidance appropriate. IA focused in the past on processes for better management of these documents and was successful with the Governance Section in getting them on the intranet with search functions and supported by software (policypoint), however both of these initiatives were somewhat abandoned in the 2017 approach to management where governance was seen as irrelevant. This has resulted in almost every audit undertaken identifying significant holes in guidance resulting in failing controls and increased risk. I am hopeful that the governance of guidance documents can be restored as part of the GRC review and restore my confidence in the system we worked so hard to improve in the past. - compliance management &ndash; for a significant part of my time at Council all Councils in Queensland have had challenges with compliance and in particular legislative compliance. Significant resources were spent with law firms trying to confirm all the legislation that impacted the various businesses of local government. Once these were established Council would track changes to the legislation through services such as lawlex and manually monitor compliance. After much lobbying and submissions (including from TCC IA) for improvement as part of amalgamation of Councils, the LGAQ developed the LGAQ compliance tool for Councils to use to track compliance. Council decided to use the tool, however its initial setup was resource intensive as their were over 7500 lines of legislation identified that may impact Councils. No one would start the process of even allocating these 7500 pieces of legislation to the relevant businesses across Council. IA took on this task after hours in order to get the process moving. The 7500 lines were dramatically reduced by removing legislation that wasn&rsquo;t specifically appropriate to TCC (i.e. legislation relating to a Councils ownership / management of its own air and seaports which TCC don&rsquo;t have) and allocated these to the various business which the Corporate Governance unit managed from that point on. Council commenced using the LGAQ compliance tool (although it had some teething issues) before this essentially became part of the 2017 abandonment of governance elements. Obviously, it has been difficult watching the amount of legislative compliance breaches Council now encounters which may have been addressed through the use of a system such as the LGAQ compliance tool and I am hopeful this may be addressed as part of the KPMG GRC review.- audit project focus &ndash; prior to commencing at Council there had been 4 different internal auditors in 4 years with little focus on internal auditing work (i.e. most were seconded to other activities or performed financial grant acquittals). I have focused the IA unit on improving Council which has required the process IA conduct for audit projects to change over time from financial to whole of entity type work. IA have focused on providing the 3rd tier of Council management (i.e. generally the General Manager level) with improvement options rather than just pointing out that something is wrong with systems or processes as many auditors do. It is easy to find issues as an auditor, it is much harder to place yourself in the Manager&rsquo;s position and endeavour to find a practical solution to the issues found. This combined with a former CEO&rsquo;s frustration with the quality of their Managers comments when addressing issues raised by IA and IA being asked to assist. This led to IA providing a solution of draft management comments to assist the Manager in understanding the direction IA believes they should take to resolve issues. This created more concise and consistent management comments to audit findings and I do not know of another audit unit who provides this service to their management group.- audit process development &ndash; I developed the Internal Audit manual based on better practice templates from the Australian National Audit Office and taking into account the requirements of the IIA&rsquo;s professional standards. While we can always improve, the manual has enabled the IA unit to pass 3 EQA&rsquo;s and endeavours to balance the needs of better practice with the realities of a 2-person unit. Larger IA units can produce significantly better QA processes and manuals with procedures, however to do this TCC IA would spend significantly more of its time on process and QA rather than actual audit work which is what we are employed to do. This is part of the debate I am now having over the recommendations of the KPMG report which if implemented would further reduce actual time IA spends on auditing. I believe I am doing the right thing in defending the current position against parts of the KPMG review rather than blindly following advice from consultants who are less qualified and with less experience than what I do.","Ethics and independence &ndash; these elements are essential and constantly being tested for Internal Auditors and I have had to painfully at times point them out to various stakeholders while working at TCC. This is not the easiest of tasks especially when the stakeholders are elected officials or senior management.Quality &ndash; I believe in a quality final product even if this is at the expense of time/resources. As the reviewer of audit work and reports I expect a quality final product as this reflects on the professionalism of the unit.Resilience and persistence - are vital. As noted in section 1 some changes take many years to show the full benefit of the ongoing work I have been part of. Unfortunately, these can also all be brought down by one poor choice by decision makers leaving you waiting for an opportunity to resurrect the process hopefully with improvements.Lateral thinker &ndash; for audit work I endeavour to link key risks across the work and work on interdependencies and challenges particularly where various parts of the business struggle to see outside their part of the activity.Collaborator &ndash; I think a key to audit reports is endeavouring to highlight to stakeholders and particular the auditees the benefits of addressing issues found and finding solutions that would be workable for the auditee while meeting the expectations for Executive and Audit Committee. Obviously, this requires running options and possible solutions constantly by auditees and in the IA Unit while you are working on the audit and noting acceptable and unacceptable options and why.Business knowledge &ndash; during my time at Council I have covered a significant portion of the business and gained relevant knowledge. While this might be a strength it can also be a challenge as various people seek information &amp; assistance which can impact your primary role.","am already well qualified for my position, however I like learning more about the business and helping improve Council for ratepayers. don&rsquo;t really have any further formal individual professional goals, however I like to be able to maintain links to the Institute of Internal Auditors and colleagues through the annual SOPAC conference. would like to find someone to train as a succession plan and be able to start transferring knowledge over the next 3-5years with a view to looking at flexible work arrangements or move sideways after that (not quite sure what this looks like at this stage). Ultimately, think I would just like to perform audit work after that 3-5 year timeframe rather than be involved in the Audit Committee/Exec/higher end management of IA unit activities. ","Remain in current role, Move sideways (explore working in different team), Flexible Working Arrangement",I plan to maintain my current professional memberships of the IIA and Chartered Accountants Australia and would like to attend the annual IIA SOPAC conference. I spend a significant amount of time on research for each Internal Audit I do which means I am constantly learning &amp; developing my skills specific to Council activities. Council would be unlikely to benefit further from me undertaking any further formal qualifications for the current position I occupy. ,"nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of EAIP this takes the form of document review and comment, with some limited support to PMO for contract RFI responses.My previous role was considerably more varied in that I would also develop electrical designs and specifications for both new and existing equipment, on-site inspections of electrical infrastructure during construction, provide electrical technical support to contract/project managers throughout construction, oversee commissioning of new infrastructure and work on councils PLC and SCADA systems.","I have more than 40 years experience in the electrical industry. I have worked in industrial, power utility, commercial and domestic fields. I have broad knowledge of the electrical industry including power distribution, instrumentation and control systems. I have 27 years experience at TCC.In previous employment I spent 9 years working for two major electrical contractors as an estimator. This provided a deep understanding of estimating, tendering, contract management, site construction techniques and client/contractor liaison.I have completed tertiary studies in electrical engineering and many specialist courses for equipment and systems in use at TCC.","My current role in EAIP is very limited, repetitive and often boring. Endless document reviews are brain numbering. I understand it is necessary work but it needs to be spread around more people. Unfortunately, there is not enough of the work to justify having more people dedicated to it. There are times when I need to seek work from other areas to cover the quiet periods.My preferred solution would be to move my position back to the Trades and Technical Services section of Water and Resource Recovery. I would again be part of a larger electrical technical team with more resources to share the work. It would provide diversity in the type of work available and ensure resource availability during occasional times of overload. It would also provide an opportunity for other technical staff to develop skills in document review and working with project/contract managers.&nbsp;I am of an age where consideration of retirement is a real thing. While I have set no definite timelines, I feel it is safe to say it will be within 5 years. If I were moved back to the technical section it would provide more opportunity to mentor the younger staff and pass on some of the skills and experience I have.&nbsp;During the covid period I found I could work successfully from home. Going forward I would like to incorporate some periods of working from home into a normal working week. My base location would still be the office but I would like the flexibility to work from home perhaps one or two days a week as situations allowed.&nbsp;I would also like to explore the option of a 4-day working week &ndash; spreading the 36.25 hours across 4 days rather than the current 9-day fortnight system of one week of 40.25 hours followed by a week of 32.25.",Change unit/section,I need to complete mandatory training as necessary to maintain my electrical worker licence. This includes CPR/LVR (annually) and electrical testing (refresher 3-yearly.I would like to increase my knowledge and skills for working with renewable energy. This would enable me to provide better technical support on projects involving solar power for example. This could involve formal training courses but more likely specialist seminars.I would like to modernise the drafting practices currently in use at TCC in relation to producing electrical drawings. We do not take full advantage of the tools modern CAD software offers. Attendance at a suitable training course and then time to develop a project to implement the learning would have a long-term positive benefit for TCC.,"regular group emails or online communication, ad hoc â€˜catch-upsâ€™ (e.g., 15 mins a day for general non-specific discussions, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly team meetings, occasional (e.g., once, or twice a year) â€˜skip levelâ€™ meetings where the manager from 2-3 levels higher (General Manager, Director, CEO) meets with employees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I see possible areas to go as follows, Waste Collection (Garage truck driver) therefore I would need a HR truck licence - which i did request in my IDP some 6-8 years ago, Traffic Management Certificate - to maybe assist if a significant natural disaster occurred such as after cyclone Yasi I think the meter readers assisted at the Townsville Dump directing traffic, or seeking some training to become useful potential to other areas with in council","Remain in current role, Flexible Working Arrangement, Change unit/section","I am Trying to achieve training to improve my longevity in my job by keeping myself reading to a high standard of accuracy and volume of meters read.&nbsp;I measure my success based on the number of routes and meters i complete each cycle taking in to consideration down time for holidays, weather, meetings and other factors.To maintain achieving this goal I&nbsp;try to operate safely in performing my duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep a level of fitness, flexibility and vision through regular self monitoring and seeking physio and doctor support. While it is possibly to do this Job and do it well as demonstrated by past employees such as Greg who recently retired I am also reminded every day that it just takes one misplaced foot on&nbsp;uneven ground, or&nbsp;roaming dog and I made need to change career options quickly through injury. Eyesight is another issue which&nbsp;could affect performance and is much harder to predict or protect from change.My goal is to make myself as employable to the organisation in other areas that i think i would be capable of doing, and enjoy doing if a became unable to maintain an acceptable level of performance in my current role. Thus the HR licence, Traffic Managment Certificates, Practical Driving Courses, perhaps a horticultural certificate in case parks and gardens became an option,&nbsp;are some of the training I would like to undergo over the next years.","lunch and learns for informal discussions about new ideas and strategies, Other","Just an ability to have a say when other departments role out changes that effect our team completing its role.

This contact list is drawn from all projects that I have interacted with that should be used as a relations tool.&nbsp;","I find that within my current role as Stakeholder Engagement Officer my primary strengths fall highly within my interpersonal skills.

The steps moving forward is respective Heads and GM approval to instigate and the development of an approved EDM template. This is relevant as a continued relationship tool and allows for greater communications and engagement reach.&nbsp;The secondary development goal is to undertake further training in Conflict Resolution through the IAP2 training package.

It means I have really good working relationships and it also means delivering Council goals are easier as we work well together to deliver them as a team.","I think my strengths include:Being personable (interpersonal skills): building relationships with my team so that we can work well to deliver outcomes collaboratively. I believe that leading a team also involves staying open and listening to my team members and offering encouragement.Organisational skills: I am highly organised and utilise tools such as One Note, Calendars, Emails, Excel spread sheets and regular meetings to manage many projects and deadlines.Creativity: I think creativity is a big one for the Education and Programs team, whether it be literal creativity in the programs we come up with, or even creative problem solving.Communication: I think I am an effective and clear communicator with my team, clearly communicating tasks and goals so that we can meet said goals. I also listen to others and take on feedback. Communication is always an area to learn in as well and I jump at any opportunity to further my communication skills.Safety First: I have learnt a lot working at Council about safety in the workplace and always put safety first. Positive safety approach has become second nature and part of every process in the Gallery.Sound knowledge of the Galleries&rsquo; role in the Community and its contribution to a vibrant and inclusive arts scene in the City.","In the next 5 years I would like to continue to grow in a leadership role as leading a team is something I really enjoy.

While this might not be my own personal development plan, this will be our&nbsp;prime focus for me and my family within the next two years (hopefully sooner). The reason this is relevant is because this ties into our&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;plans (potentially within the next 5 years),&nbsp;and all activities in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;From a personal perspective, I&#39;d be more than happy to continue growing and learning within Stakeholder Engagement. I would like to reach a level where I feel confident in every situation and have a good understand how to action/resolve&nbsp;each problem - I try to work on this every&nbsp;day. I think this can easily be achieved simply by surrounding myself in different projects and with repetition, potentially with&nbsp;further studies or IAP2 training.&nbsp;I would also like to reach a point where I feel&nbsp;confident to review my&nbsp;current Position Description (PD) to reflect my contributions within Stakeholder Engagement so that I&#39;m not classified as a &#39;Customer Service Rep&#39;. (ie. going up levels).&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get better at time management, project management, problem solving, marketing, and&nbsp;networking within the town (internally &amp; externally).&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of me would like to get into a&nbsp;creative space again, however I do not know what that truly looks like. Since starting my small local business, I have found a spark for &#39;creating&#39; again -&nbsp;I&#39;ve been enjoying the designing, photography &amp; videography aspects of the business and could easily see myself doing this as a career. Stakeholder Engagement has also contributed to this each time I have gone out to get project update photos for Have Your Say - it might not seem like a&nbsp;creative activity, however it is something I take pride in and enjoy. Unfortunately this type of career change would be harder&nbsp;to achieve as this would require some form of study / learning program and time is restrict enough as it is, however I will not rule this out as an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for this to become realistic, wifey &amp; I would need to both be working comfortably and ideally Willow would need to be at school as daycare is not an option. (Night school or off-campus study would also work).&nbsp;&nbsp;3-4 Year Plan: Both parties (Kim &amp; I) working full time with&nbsp;Willow at school, making study / workshops / personal development freely available whilst two incomes are steadily&nbsp;flowing.&nbsp;If still within&nbsp;Council, &#39;climb&nbsp;the ladder&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Potentially look at secondments and work in other departments&nbsp;for further exposure, development and understanding just as I have done since start at Council. I enjoy mixing it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;5+ Year Plan: Personally I find it hard to think about what 5 Years time will look like, however eventfully I would like to go into full-time business, whether that be clothing, printing services, collectables, or something else creative I would ultimately like to call it &#39;my own&#39;. All of these things are currently hobbies that I do on a daily basis, however hopefully one day, one of these hobbies will flourish into something&nbsp; bigger. I can not hide the fact that I love the &#39;hustle&#39; and do entrepreneurial things however I have come to terms that there is a lot of risk involved with doing these activities full-time / steadily, which is why Council will remain in the equation for as long as possible / long as it needs to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I find that these &#39;dreams&#39; are not achievable or realistic by this time in life, I would be content with remaining in Council (government) due to the steadiness and&nbsp;consistency. However by this point I would like to have achieved the following:&nbsp;- Some form of study to compliment my career and/or personal choices.&nbsp;- Exposure to management within a role&nbsp;- Confident in high level problem solving&nbsp;- Be higher up than a level 3&nbsp;haha.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Soz Hannay, my&nbsp;IDP might be the messiest one in Council but hopefully I&#39;ve given you enough to work on something).&nbsp;","Looking for a career change outside of role, Seeking promotion, Remain in current role",- Some form of study to compliment my career and/or personal choices.&nbsp;- Exposure to management / ownership within a role.- Confident in high level problem solving.&nbsp;- Move up in levels.&nbsp;,Other,Catch up whenever milestones are achieved to re-evaluate plans.&nbsp;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The utility of having generic TGSs is that we can use them in for works in situations that don&#39;t particularly require complex traffic management solutions. Using generics for simple jobs means instead of being weighed down&nbsp;drawing every plan for every job, we can better utilize our time to perform our other duties such as&nbsp;site inspections, audits, ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;","I believe my strength that I bring to the team is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;My extensive experience as a traffic management implementer/team leader over a ten-year long career.&nbsp;&gt; My diligence in staying up to date with the new AUSROADs standards for temp. traffic management, ensuring TCC remains compliant with legislative requirements.&gt;My background in health and safety. In my previous job I was ALTUS&#39;s safety rep for the Townsville region, in that time I contributed to the development of their new SWMS alongside other HSR&nbsp;committee members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; My enthusiasm to develop innovations to improve&nbsp;productivity and safety.&nbsp; Most recently, I had the idea to put a QR code on our stop/slow TGSs that would direct traffic controllers to an online- queue length calculator.&nbsp; A dynamic solution to address the requirements of a site-specific queue length.&nbsp;&nbsp;","What do you want to professionally achieve in the next 5 years?&nbsp;&gt;Expand my knowledge and utility by undergoing more training.&nbsp;&gt;Go on the on-call B roster.&nbsp;&gt;I would like to commute more with other industry professionals. IPWEAQ and TMAA hold regular&nbsp;conferences about temp. traffic management.&gt;&nbsp;I would like to expand upon our library of generic TGSs to further streamline our workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;Update our library of TGSs reoccurring works (POSE, electrical) to the new standards.&nbsp;&gt;Potentially studying Traffic Engineering?&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Flexible work arrangements, retirement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;I think that council should implement a hybrid system where those with the capacity to do so can work from home for 1-2 days a fortnight.This will work to mitigate the rising costs of commuting to work and improve worker morale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;What does excite you about coming to work?&nbsp;&gt; I enjoy coming up with solutions to complicated traffic control requirements/problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","Remain in current role, Develop/ expand in current role, Flexible Working Arrangement","Goal:&nbsp;S: Become a traffic engineer/REPQM: I will measure success by the completion of my aim.&nbsp;A: Obtain approval, organise an arrangement to study/work at the same time&nbsp;R: Probably not the right time now, maybe in 1-2 years.&nbsp;T: Timeframe: begin goal in 1-2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;",Other,&gt;I believe that the duties and responsibilities of my position more accurately reflect an LGO 5 rather than an LGO 4 and should therefore be re-banded appropriately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the serials were greatly neglected when I came into this role, and with very little serials knowledge or experience in the new team, I am proud of what I learned and how hard I worked to fix the errors and get it functioning properly.&nbsp;I consistently contributed to the Riverway collections working group and put in a lot of hard work with the Thuringowa closure, often working autonomously to collect data, make decisions, and weed a huge amount of items. &nbsp;I developed and delivered several training sessions for new staff regarding the collection. &nbsp;I trained several staff members and work experience students in areas such as courier, bulk loan selections and delivery, serials, circulation tasks, and shelving. &nbsp;I presented to the GM at a meeting. &nbsp;I provided a consistently high level of customer service, both on the floor and in my role when talking to bulk loan customers and purchasing item requests. &nbsp;I helped organise the Share the Dignity donations &nbsp;I figured out how to activate an RFID tag without having to catalogue an item for use on the board games for after-hours activities. Discovered that RFID tags do not work on iPads. This was done to provide a service for the L&amp;I team. &nbsp;Worked with the team to create new processes and written procedures such as handling the Iron Mountain items, a spreadsheet for re-ordering items while on the floor, how to fix common issues with serials. &nbsp;Led the weeding and transfer of collections such as home service stack, large print and YA manga.&nbsp;Worked to make sure bulk loan selections were always done on time. &nbsp;Catalogued several books myself, which involved downloading or creating a record from scratch, adding holdings, choosing a Dewey number, creating a spine label, and sending it to Michelle to process. Sparked lots of great conversations in the team about where items belong in our collection and why. &nbsp;Created and deployed several Facebook and Instagram posts to promote the collection. Generated Facebook stats each month for the business development planning officers. &nbsp;Uploaded and maintained the digital screens in each of the branches. &nbsp;Worked to maintain the catalogue by deleting lost items, refreshing popular items, organising series, uploading and editing MARC records, and actioning high demand item reports.

Everyone learns differently, so I have encouraged the team to edit these themselves to suit their own personal learning ways. Coming into my third year in the team, I am across every single task.

The latter was originally a role that my team leader was responsible for, however upon realising I had capacity where he did not, I opted to absorb this into my own role. I am extremely proficient in my own position, confidently making decisions that can financially impact some of Townsville&rsquo;s most disadvantaged ratepayers. I have recently begun to branch out and begin completing the Supplementary Run reports; although I have only done this once so far, I hope to take this responsibility on for the foreseeable future to grow my knowledge and confidence and feel as though I am contributing more in such a stressful period.","I am quite literally the correspondence queen within my team and am often called upon to help construct or review letters and emails. I have excellent recall and can often remember exactly what I did on a property and why just by hearing the address or surname. I am always eager to put my hand up to learn new skills or assist in other areas of the team when I have the capacity to do so, which also expands my knowledge of the different positions. I bring an air of sass and humour to the team and really aim to keep them on their toes in both the best and worst ways.","In the next five years I hope to have rotated through all Billing Officer positions and have a much stronger understanding of everything that goes into our Rates, especially the charges aspect. I would like to explore charges more to prepare for assisting in Rates weekends, as I feel this is a task that should be shared around. However, in saying this I would like to see the implementation of pay banding to encourage retention. I thoroughly enjoy this job and my team, however feel that the current pay structure does not accurately reflect the skills, knowledge, and responsibility that comes with every passing year. Pay banding from level 3 to level 4 would create an incentive to remain within the position, and if the last year has taught Council anything, it&rsquo;s that retention is highly important within this team. I also don&rsquo;t believe it to be fair that a new starter doing less than half of their role, with a very limited understanding of the position, should be receiving a very similar pay to other members of the team who work diligently, have significantly more experience and knowledge, and take on higher workloads with more responsibility. This could very easily show senior billing officers than they could drop half of their professional capacity and still receive the same income.",Develop/ expand in current role,"I intend to undertake and complete a Certificate IV in Business to expand my current knowledge and understanding of my role. This request has been approved by all members of my management team; however, it is currently sitting with the Qualifications/Procurement team for approval. This was submitted to the above teams on 21/10/2022 and despite following up twice, I have still not received a response. I would appreciate this being followed up by a member of management higher than me to ensure I begin studies in January or February at the latest, as I will soon approach the rotation of my position and would like to strengthen my skills prior to this.","nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports, Other","I believe the pay banding mentioned earlier should also apply to my team leader, and if not, then some of his workload needs to be delegated elsewhere.

I have also gathered a lot of knowledge on workplace health and safety due to becoming a Health and Safety Representative&nbsp;in my work team. This is things like learning about the workplace health and safety act and what it consists of and how to apply those practices to my everyday work. With this also comes the task of taking on any health and safety issues that my fellow workmates may encounter and reporting them to the safety committee. One example that I have brought up is the fire-retardant shirts that we wear for work. I have trial ran multiple different shirts and found the best one for my&nbsp;work team to wear.,"Some strengths that I have brought to my role and work team&nbsp;is trying to keep team morale high by helping whoever I can whenever I can.&nbsp;For example, pulling&nbsp;someone&nbsp;aside&nbsp;when they may seem down and talking to them about anything they may be having trouble with at the time and helping them in any way that I can. I also keep good preparation&nbsp;with jobs that I may be doing on site by thinking about what my workmate may need next for their job and having it ready and useable by the time they&#39;re on to their next step in the work. Another strength I have that also plays into the preparation side of things is by keeping my welding bay tidy after every job that I complete to allow for good organisation&nbsp;for the next job that I will be commencing.","The things I want to achieve in the next 5 years is to finish my training and to become a qualified tradesman, then either stay in the organisation I am currently in or move on to go to the mines either doing shutdowns or working there week on/week off&nbsp;depending on what happens by the end of my time.

I have physically visited some of the key recording stations to know about their conditions and relevant issues and also participated in the annual inspection program to some of the gauging stations with the BOM team. I have identified several maintenance issues and helped our unit to raise work orders to conduct the maintenance work. I have also organised purchase order to install a Transducer at Black Weir at Ross River which will be used to monitor low water levels during the draught season. As a system administrator to the TARDIS and Enviromon I regularly check the communication of the gauging stations with the server to maintain a smooth operation. I generate report with rainfall and water level records after any heavy incidents and distribute them to several key personnel within the council for their information.Besides overseeing the hydrological network, I am also involved in two flood studies currently being undertaken by the Council. I was involved in the tender evaluation for the proposals submitted by the consultants for those two studies and now actively following up with the work activities. I am also trying to familiarise myself with the flood models available within the council and have been practicing the TUFLOW Model to improve my modelling skill. I am also included in the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group (TLDMG) and attended several meetings, training, road show and drill programs at LDCC for the preparedness for upcoming monsoon season.

When leading an inspection, I feel significantly more confident with my ability to assess a premises against the Food Standards Food, Food Act and other relevant legislation","My strengths include resilience, determination, and respect. I work well within a team environment as I respect those I work with as we all have a passion for EH. It is fulfilling being in a team with likeminded people and I feel like my strengths will contribute a lot to the team dynamic in the future as my determination to complete all my work to a high standard and my resilience to adversity complement each other.

I&rsquo;d like to accept all the courses that council could offer me as I believe its all beneficial to both my professional and personal development. What currently excites me about coming to work is that I&rsquo;m in the industry that I&rsquo;ve been studying to be a part of over the past 4 years. Becoming an EHO with local government will allow me to develop the skills necessary to be successful in this industry, this excites me for the future as more opportunities through both council and the EH industry will present themselves to me the more qualified I become.","Develop/ expand in current role, Seeking promotion","My current learning and development goal is to attain full EHO status, this can be measured by successfully completing the graduate program and obtaining an EHO position, the steps required to attain this goal is to be exposed to as much experience from others as I can, by means of shadowing, asking questions, and leading inspections. This is relevant to my long-term objectives as I will be a nationally recognised EHO. If I ever have the desire to move outside of QLD I know that having previously been an EHO in QLD I could easily gain employment elsewhere, this displays the security that this field provides which is a comforting feeling. The time frame of this goal is 2 years, as I start the graduate program in 2023 I would expect that I would achieve this goal in the period of the program or sooner.","nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I still need someone around to supervise/confirm certain things on the bench and even housekeeping (how to wash Hach TN tubes), how to prepare reagents, whether certain samples need to be filtered/diluted&nbsp; or not, etc. I try to stick to housekeeping whenever there is spare time and this has resulted in decluttering the place (cardboard boxes and old stuff in the emergency exit/muffle space, Christmas tree in entrance, etc.) and keeping stock of equipment on the bench up. So far I have been able to go out sampling twice (fountains and weirs &amp; Oak valley/FF) and really enjoyed this part of the job.

I believe I have listened and taken on board important procedures and skills well, retaining and noting everything possible&nbsp;to expand my understanding, to eventually put these skills into practice.

I believe a strength of mine is being self-manageable, keeping myself busy with jobs and always making effort to be better and learn. From this I believe I am both flexible and dependable, when it comes to the high-pressured environment which can be experienced in the lab, and out in field when sampling.
