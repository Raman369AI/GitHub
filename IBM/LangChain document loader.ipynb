Each client provides their data in different formats: some in PDFs, others in Word documents, CSV files, or even HTML webpages. Manually loading and parsing each document type is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. Your goal is to streamline this process, making it efficient and error-free.\n","\n","To achieve this, you'll use LangChainâ€™s powerful document loaders. These loaders allow you to read and convert various file formats into a unified document structure that can be easily processed. For example, you'll load client policy documents from text files, financial reports from PDFs, marketing strategies from Word documents, and product reviews from JSON files. By the end of this lab, you will have a robust pipeline that can handle any new file formats clients might send, saving you valuable time and effort.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0851f784-c7c0-4575-a998-b71cb96097d0","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/Hvf-jk8b5Fs-E_E4AJyEow/loader.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"indexing\"/>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a94cf0f8-104e-47e7-b12c-4bbea304cd12","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["In this lab, you will explore how to use various loaders provided by LangChain to load and process data from different file formats.
