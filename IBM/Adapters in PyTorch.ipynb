    "You can fine-tune a neural network in several ways. Common strategies include adjusting only the final layer or fine-tuning all layers. However, these methods have their drawbacks: fine-tuning just the final layer often leads to less than optimal results, while fine-tuning all layers can be very time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, researchers have developed various parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. One such technique involves the use of adapters. Adapters enable modular training, where small, task-specific modules are trained within the model without changing the pre-existing pretrained parameters. This approach efficiently tailors the model to new tasks with a reduced risk of overfitting. However, adapters are not a cure-all solution. While they are less likely to overfit and are computationally efficient, they might not always reach the same level of accuracy as full model fine-tuning, particularly if the task necessitates substantial changes from the pretrained model's original capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you learn how to apply an adapter to a transformer-based neural network that has been trained on the AG News data set, with the aim of using this model on the IMDB data set. You also evaluate and compare the performance of this method with that of a fully fine-tuned model and a model where only the last layer is fine-tuned.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Reviews**: The data set consists of 50,000 movie reviews, divided evenly into 25,000 training and 25,000 testing samples.\n",
    "- **Sentiment labels**: Each review is labeled as either positive or negative, indicating the sentiment expressed in the review. The data set is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews in both the training and testing sets.\n",
    "- **Text content**: Reviews are presented as plain text and have been preprocessed to some extent. For example, HTML tags are removed, but the text retains its original punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The data set is commonly used to train models for binary sentiment classification, where the goal is to predict whether a given review is positive or negative based on its text content.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment analysis**: The primary application of the IMDB data set is in sentiment analysis, where it serves as a benchmark for various text classification algorithms.\n",

    "# Adapters\n",
    "FeatureAdapter is a neural network module that introduces a low-dimensional bottleneck in a transformer architecture to allow fine-tuning with fewer parameters. It compresses the original high-dimensional embeddings into a lower dimension, applies a non-linear transformation, and then expands it back to the original dimension. This process is followed by a residual\n",
    "connection that adds the transformed output back to the original input to preserve information and\n",
    "promote gradient flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of using adapters in neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient fine-tuning**: Adapters allow for targeted updates to specific parts of the model, reducing the need to retrain large sections of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter efficiency**: By adding only a few parameters, adapters make it feasible to modify large models without substantial computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preservation of pretrained features**: Adapters enable the modification of a model while retaining the valuable features learned during extensive pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity and flexibility**: They enhance the modularity of models, allowing easy adaptation to various tasks without altering core architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task-specific adaptation**: Adapters can be tailored to improve performance on particular tasks, optimizing the model’s effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transfer learning and domain adaptation**: They facilitate the adaptation of models to new domains, bridging gaps between different data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continual learning**: Adapters support the model's ability to learn new information continuously without forgetting previous knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced risk of overfitting**: With fewer trainable parameters, adapters help prevent overfitting, especially on smaller data sets.\n",
