Identification of Poisonous mushrooms:
Key characteristics:
Cap Characteristics
Gill Structure
Spore-Color
Stem Features
Odor
Season

Cap Diameter: The measurement of the cap across its widest point. It helps in identifying the mushroom’s size and can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters.

Cap Shape: The overall shape of the cap, such as conical, bell-shaped, flat, or wavy. This characteristic helps in distinguishing different species.
Cap shape can be a clear predictor based on the EDA as there is clear distinction between both the classes.

CAP SURFACE: The texture and appearance of the cap’s surface. It can be smooth, scaly, sticky, or wrinkled, providing clues about the mushroom’s identity.
Cap surface can be a clear predictor based on the EDA as there is clear distinction between both the classes, except for t and g.

CAP COLOR: The color of the cap, which can vary widely and may change as the mushroom matures. Color can be a key factor in identifying species.
Cap color is also a good predictor for the mushrooms.

Does Bruise or Bleed: Refers to whether the mushroom changes color when bruised or if it releases a colored liquid. This reaction can be important for identification.
Not a good indicator as there is not much of a clear distinction.

Gill Attachment: How the gills are attached to the stem. They can be free (not attached), attached (connected to the stem), or descending (extending down the stem).
Can be used but not a clear indicator
Gill Spacing: The distance between gills. Gills can be crowded, spaced, or intermediate in their spacing.
Not good enough

GILL COLOR: The color of the gills, which can help in distinguishing species and may change with age.
Can be an indicator

Stem Height: The length of the stem from the ground to where the cap is attached. Variations in stem height can aid in identification.

Stem Width: The diameter of the stem. It can be narrow, medium, or wide, and varies among species.

Stem Root: The base of the stem, which can be swollen, bulbous, or tapering. Observing the stem’s base can help identify certain mushrooms.
Good indicator

Stem Surface: The texture and appearance of the stem’s surface. It can be smooth, fibrous, scaly, or rough.
Good indicator

STEM COLOR: The color of the stem, which might be uniform or vary along its length.
Ok indicator
Veil Type: Refers to the type of veil present on the mushroom, such as a partial veil (covering the gills and often forming a ring) or a universal veil (enveloping the entire mushroom in its early stages).
Good indicator
Veil Color: The color of the veil. It can be a key characteristic for identifying mushrooms, especially in distinguishing between species with similar appearances.

Has Ring: Indicates whether the mushroom has a ring (also called an annulus) around the stem, which is a remnant of the partial veil.
Good indicator
Ring Type: Describes the type of ring present, such as a single ring, double ring, or a ring that is flaring or hanging.
Good enough
Spore Print Color: The color of the spore print obtained by placing the cap on a white sheet of paper. This is a critical identifying feature.
Good
Habitat: The environment where the mushroom is found, such as woodlands, grasslands, or urban areas. The habitat can help narrow down the possible species.
Not enough
Season: The time of year when the mushroom appears. Different species fruit in different seasons, which helps in identification.
