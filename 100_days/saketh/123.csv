I have represented council on many matters as the delegated senior local government officer to mediate planning and development court appeals. This has involved significant negotiation with external parties in order to reach suitable agreements. This included matters such as the Pinnacles Development (an out of sequence urban development) and the Weststate Private Hospital (submitter appeal); I have also represented council on complex planning matters including negotiating significant infrastructure agreements for major developments.I have continued to provide a high level of customer service to our key stakeholders, and further provided support and mentoring to senior staff to continue to provide a high level of service.&nbsp;","In relation to my strengths, I consider these include:-&nbsp;&nbsp;* have a calm and measured approach to complex and stressful issues, which assists with team culture.* significant experience in the planning and development sector across multiple areas which allows me to make balanced decisions.&nbsp;* Listen to issues, provide accountability and responsibly to staff, to ensure I empower staff to make decisions.* Have the customer interests at the heart of my decisions and overall service to the community, which&nbsp;includes striving to provide a high level of service.* developed&nbsp;a good professional relationship with staff, including coaching and mentoring where required.&nbsp;&nbsp;","OVERALL PROFESSIONAL GOALS&nbsp;* Improve the overall customer experience and business improvements to be a&nbsp;leader in QLD in relation to planning and development services.&nbsp;* Implement mobility in the workplace and move to full&nbsp;electronic lodgement / assessment and approval&nbsp;across the entire team.&nbsp;* Continue to create a positive team culture that has the shared vision to deliver these outcomes.&nbsp;* Continue to strive to reduce development assessment timeframes to meet the customer service commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;SKILL DEVELOPMENT&nbsp;* Opportunities to act in the Chief Planning and Development Officer role, when the opportunity arises, to continue to broaden my skills and and variety of work tasks.&nbsp;*Have opportunities with secondment roles&nbsp;as they arise to continue to enhance skills and have different skills and learnings.&nbsp; This is not an immediate need, but something for consideration into the future.&nbsp;* Opportunities to work on different projects and initiatives, which sometimes don&#39;t directly align with development assessment, but align with my multi-discipline experience in council.&nbsp; &nbsp;A good example in&nbsp;my current role is leading the CBD property conversion study.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could also be other projects in the City Growth space into the future (i.e. key place making projects or other strategic land use projects).&nbsp;* Opportunity from time to time, to have some flexibility to work from home (i.e. one day a fortnight, where this works for the organisation and the employee).&nbsp;&nbsp;* Continue to work on improving customer service and business improvement projects for the department, as part of the current project, and also sub-projects that may be identified.&nbsp;","Develop/ expand in current role, Secondment opportunities","1.

As a member of the Library Leadership Team and working with HSRs, I have contributed to the achievement of an improved safety culture in the library through:&middot; Improvement in safety measures&middot; additional awareness and actioning of safety related matters&middot; ongoing revision of processes and procedures&middot; rolling out of initiatives such as the Conditions of Entry&nbsp;In 2022, a new Collections Team came together. Consisting of three staff who were all new to the roles. Recruiting a team with not only the technical skills, but also the behavours to complement each other&rsquo;s strengths was an achievement.

Together they will go far, and I am proud to have brought them together.. &nbsp;In 2021 I was given the opportunity to act as Team Manager of Libraries for 6 months, This was during a time of internal turmoil within the library. During this time, I brought stability and consistency to the library service and I have received feedbackfrom colleagues that the library team felt more calm during this time. &nbsp;In 2020, a change to library hours was mooted. This discussion has been ongoing since then, moving from reducing hours because of COVID to increasing them substantially and trialling shopping centre hours to determine the needs and wants of the community. In the leadup, I provided many versions of rosters and costings to support each model of hours suggested by CEL Leadership, culminating in the current offering. I lead the roll-out of the extended hours, working with the different teams across the library and Council, including marketing and safety. The trial is now underway, and requires me to work closely with our front facing team to understand their challenges, as well as removing any barriers so that they can work effectively, efficiently and with the community in focus.","More than 30 years of organisational knowledge of Townsville Library Service.

The primary areas where I believe I have done well / achieved improvements aligned to my role include;- audit unit development &ndash; I have been involved in the development of all Internal Audit and Audit Committee governance documents at Council at varying levels (i.e. drafting, reviewing, providing technical advice based on legislative and professional body better practice advice) depending on the circumstances at the time (i.e. initial setup of documents, conversion of documents at amalgamation of the new TCC, updating for the 2017 reduction process). I have implemented a QA process for IA and aligned Council with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) external quality assessment (EQA) process. The IA Unit has achieved a pass rating for all 3 EQA&rsquo;s which examine approximately 50 principles and standards and are conducted every 5 years in accordance with the IIA framework for professional auditing. This provides Executive Management and Audit Committee members with assurance that Internal Audit is functioning effectively and in alignment with the world largest professional Internal Auditing body&rsquo;s standards. Members of the IA unit are encouraged to be members of the IIA and seek to obtain professional qualifications as Certified Internal Auditors (CIA) and Certification in Risk Management Assurance (CRMA) which are both 18-month examination-based courses. I have achieved both qualifications early in my time at Council. - risk management &ndash; I hold a CRMA (Certification in Risk Management Assurance) from the Institute of Internal Auditors providing significant insight into how risk management works and can be linked to assurance such as that provided by Internal Audit. The CRMA highlights that I am not only qualified to undertake risk management but also to audit others that provide risk management. I was briefly at one stage Councils Internal Audit and Risk Manager until the roles were correctly split at amalgamation. I have always championed risk management and challenged risk management processes at various stages, however it is always a management decision on direction for risk. I have undertaken consulting work in risk including providing risks for fraud after the QAO advised management that Councils fraud risk management was at too high a level to be useful in effective risk management. This project started with approximately 10 fraud risks and finished with approximately 40 fraud risks which were provided to management as a baseline for Councils fraud risk management. This avoided the QAO&rsquo;s ongoing attention and for those areas of Council that took the information provided seriously, it provided a decent start to better managing their fraud risks. Risk management being at too high a level is now a familiar theme for strategic and operational risks and forms part of the KPMG GRC review.- disaster management &ndash; disaster management as Council currently knows it didn&rsquo;t exist when I commenced at council (i.e. there was no local disaster management group with plans and a local disaster coordination centre, let alone a Cat 5 rated LDCC, no Council wide ER or BCP). I was requested (early in my time at Council) by the lead engineer for disaster management (Al Morris) with trying to gain buy in to the process and to get Council to take seriously the new (at that time) Disaster Management Act 2003. This was supported by the regional Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) officer (Wayne Preedy -now Councils Local Disaster Coordinator). Allen worked for a number years slowly gaining improvements and raising more peoples awareness of the risks and gaining better facilities, plans, procedures and exercises to test awareness. Wayne continues this work to this day. Internal Audit assisted by raising awareness through reports into disaster management, ER, BCP and attending key meetings (to support good risk management and assurance around disaster management). A number of competing agenda&rsquo;s needed to be resolved to bring together the framework and what Council has today to be able to understand the roles of the TLDMG and how this integrates with Emergency Response, Business Continuity planning and elements such as building evacuation plans. I am exceptionally proud of where Council now is for disaster management and the part IA has played in what we have today, with a Mayor / Council and Executive who have great buy in and they drive this work onwards leaving IA to work on just tidying up bits and pieces to assist in keeping things on track (i.e. highlighting new advances to consider, keeping training, records and plans in order with health check audits)- guidance document management &ndash; almost every audit starts with what guidance (i.e. policy, administrative directives, corporate and departmental procedures) exists and is the guidance appropriate. IA focused in the past on processes for better management of these documents and was successful with the Governance Section in getting them on the intranet with search functions and supported by software (policypoint), however both of these initiatives were somewhat abandoned in the 2017 approach to management where governance was seen as irrelevant. This has resulted in almost every audit undertaken identifying significant holes in guidance resulting in failing controls and increased risk. I am hopeful that the governance of guidance documents can be restored as part of the GRC review and restore my confidence in the system we worked so hard to improve in the past. - compliance management &ndash; for a significant part of my time at Council all Councils in Queensland have had challenges with compliance and in particular legislative compliance. Significant resources were spent with law firms trying to confirm all the legislation that impacted the various businesses of local government. Once these were established Council would track changes to the legislation through services such as lawlex and manually monitor compliance. After much lobbying and submissions (including from TCC IA) for improvement as part of amalgamation of Councils, the LGAQ developed the LGAQ compliance tool for Councils to use to track compliance. Council decided to use the tool, however its initial setup was resource intensive as their were over 7500 lines of legislation identified that may impact Councils. No one would start the process of even allocating these 7500 pieces of legislation to the relevant businesses across Council. IA took on this task after hours in order to get the process moving. The 7500 lines were dramatically reduced by removing legislation that wasn&rsquo;t specifically appropriate to TCC (i.e. legislation relating to a Councils ownership / management of its own air and seaports which TCC don&rsquo;t have) and allocated these to the various business which the Corporate Governance unit managed from that point on. Council commenced using the LGAQ compliance tool (although it had some teething issues) before this essentially became part of the 2017 abandonment of governance elements. Obviously, it has been difficult watching the amount of legislative compliance breaches Council now encounters which may have been addressed through the use of a system such as the LGAQ compliance tool and I am hopeful this may be addressed as part of the KPMG GRC review.- audit project focus &ndash; prior to commencing at Council there had been 4 different internal auditors in 4 years with little focus on internal auditing work (i.e. most were seconded to other activities or performed financial grant acquittals). I have focused the IA unit on improving Council which has required the process IA conduct for audit projects to change over time from financial to whole of entity type work. IA have focused on providing the 3rd tier of Council management (i.e. generally the General Manager level) with improvement options rather than just pointing out that something is wrong with systems or processes as many auditors do. It is easy to find issues as an auditor, it is much harder to place yourself in the Manager&rsquo;s position and endeavour to find a practical solution to the issues found. This combined with a former CEO&rsquo;s frustration with the quality of their Managers comments when addressing issues raised by IA and IA being asked to assist. This led to IA providing a solution of draft management comments to assist the Manager in understanding the direction IA believes they should take to resolve issues. This created more concise and consistent management comments to audit findings and I do not know of another audit unit who provides this service to their management group.- audit process development &ndash; I developed the Internal Audit manual based on better practice templates from the Australian National Audit Office and taking into account the requirements of the IIA&rsquo;s professional standards. While we can always improve, the manual has enabled the IA unit to pass 3 EQA&rsquo;s and endeavours to balance the needs of better practice with the realities of a 2-person unit. Larger IA units can produce significantly better QA processes and manuals with procedures, however to do this TCC IA would spend significantly more of its time on process and QA rather than actual audit work which is what we are employed to do. This is part of the debate I am now having over the recommendations of the KPMG report which if implemented would further reduce actual time IA spends on auditing. I believe I am doing the right thing in defending the current position against parts of the KPMG review rather than blindly following advice from consultants who are less qualified and with less experience than what I do.","Ethics and independence &ndash; these elements are essential and constantly being tested for Internal Auditors and I have had to painfully at times point them out to various stakeholders while working at TCC. This is not the easiest of tasks especially when the stakeholders are elected officials or senior management.Quality &ndash; I believe in a quality final product even if this is at the expense of time/resources. As the reviewer of audit work and reports I expect a quality final product as this reflects on the professionalism of the unit.Resilience and persistence - are vital. As noted in section 1 some changes take many years to show the full benefit of the ongoing work I have been part of. Unfortunately, these can also all be brought down by one poor choice by decision makers leaving you waiting for an opportunity to resurrect the process hopefully with improvements.Lateral thinker &ndash; for audit work I endeavour to link key risks across the work and work on interdependencies and challenges particularly where various parts of the business struggle to see outside their part of the activity.Collaborator &ndash; I think a key to audit reports is endeavouring to highlight to stakeholders and particular the auditees the benefits of addressing issues found and finding solutions that would be workable for the auditee while meeting the expectations for Executive and Audit Committee. Obviously, this requires running options and possible solutions constantly by auditees and in the IA Unit while you are working on the audit and noting acceptable and unacceptable options and why.Business knowledge &ndash; during my time at Council I have covered a significant portion of the business and gained relevant knowledge. While this might be a strength it can also be a challenge as various people seek information &amp; assistance which can impact your primary role.","am already well qualified for my position, however I like learning more about the business and helping improve Council for ratepayers. don&rsquo;t really have any further formal individual professional goals, however I like to be able to maintain links to the Institute of Internal Auditors and colleagues through the annual SOPAC conference. would like to find someone to train as a succession plan and be able to start transferring knowledge over the next 3-5years with a view to looking at flexible work arrangements or move sideways after that (not quite sure what this looks like at this stage). Ultimately, think I would just like to perform audit work after that 3-5 year timeframe rather than be involved in the Audit Committee/Exec/higher end management of IA unit activities. ","Remain in current role, Move sideways (explore working in different team), Flexible Working Arrangement",I plan to maintain my current professional memberships of the IIA and Chartered Accountants Australia and would like to attend the annual IIA SOPAC conference. I spend a significant amount of time on research for each Internal Audit I do which means I am constantly learning &amp; developing my skills specific to Council activities. Council would be unlikely to benefit further from me undertaking any further formal qualifications for the current position I occupy. ,"nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endless document reviews are brain numbering. I understand it is necessary work but it needs to be spread around more people. Unfortunately, there is not enough of the work to justify having more people dedicated to it. There are times when I need to seek work from other areas to cover the quiet periods.My preferred solution would be to move my position back to the Trades and Technical Services section of Water and Resource Recovery. I would again be part of a larger electrical technical team with more resources to share the work. It would provide diversity in the type of work available and ensure resource availability during occasional times of overload. It would also provide an opportunity for other technical staff to develop skills in document review and working with project/contract managers.&nbsp;I am of an age where consideration of retirement is a real thing. While I have set no definite timelines, I feel it is safe to say it will be within 5 years. If I were moved back to the technical section it would provide more opportunity to mentor the younger staff and pass on some of the skills and experience I have.&nbsp;During the covid period I found I could work successfully from home. Going forward I would like to incorporate some periods of working from home into a normal working week. My base location would still be the office but I would like the flexibility to work from home perhaps one or two days a week as situations allowed.&nbsp;I would also like to explore the option of a 4-day working week &ndash; spreading the 36.25 hours across 4 days rather than the current 9-day fortnight system of one week of 40.25 hours followed by a week of 32.25.",Change unit/section,I need to complete mandatory training as necessary to maintain my electrical worker licence. This includes CPR/LVR (annually) and electrical testing (refresher 3-yearly.I would like to increase my knowledge and skills for working with renewable energy. This would enable me to provide better technical support on projects involving solar power for example. This could involve formal training courses but more likely specialist seminars.I would like to modernise the drafting practices currently in use at TCC in relation to producing electrical drawings. We do not take full advantage of the tools modern CAD software offers. Attendance at a suitable training course and then time to develop a project to implement the learning would have a long-term positive benefit for TCC.,"regular group emails or online communication, ad hoc â€˜catch-upsâ€™ (e.g., 15 mins a day for general non-specific discussions, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly team meetings, occasional (e.g., once, or twice a year) â€˜skip levelâ€™ meetings where the manager from 2-3 levels higher (General Manager, Director, CEO) meets with employees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have achieved career progression, having started as a Gallery Assistant, then Education and Programs Assistant, then Education and Programs Officer, to my current role as Senior Education and Programs Officer. &nbsp;I have&nbsp;&lsquo;learned experience&rsquo;, working my way up in terms of career path means I have entered the senior role with experience in each of the roles I manage which I think is invaluable. &nbsp;I think another thing I would say what I have done well is build, develop and maintain really good working relationships within my team and the greater Gallery team, something that I believe is absolutely essential in my role. It means I have really good working relationships and it also means delivering Council goals are easier as we work well together to deliver them as a team.","I think my strengths include:Being personable (interpersonal skills): building relationships with my team so that we can work well to deliver outcomes collaboratively. I believe that leading a team also involves staying open and listening to my team members and offering encouragement.Organisational skills: I am highly organised and utilise tools such as One Note, Calendars, Emails, Excel spread sheets and regular meetings to manage many projects and deadlines.Creativity: I think creativity is a big one for the Education and Programs team, whether it be literal creativity in the programs we come up with, or even creative problem solving.Communication: I think I am an effective and clear communicator with my team, clearly communicating tasks and goals so that we can meet said goals. I also listen to others and take on feedback. Communication is always an area to learn in as well and I jump at any opportunity to further my communication skills.Safety First: I have learnt a lot working at Council about safety in the workplace and always put safety first. Positive safety approach has become second nature and part of every process in the Gallery.Sound knowledge of the Galleries&rsquo; role in the Community and its contribution to a vibrant and inclusive arts scene in the City.","In the next 5 years I would like to continue to grow in a leadership role as leading a team is something I really enjoy. It would be great to do some more skill development in leadership as I have found the recent supervisory training and Gallery team workshop really valuable. &nbsp;I also think the creative aspect of what we do is what excites me as it can be a really fun part of the job, as well as connecting with people - artists, community members, external and internal stakeholders &ndash; so I would like to see my networking skills grow so I continue to build these important relationships and make meaningful long lasting&nbsp;connections with my work.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Develop/ expand in current role, Seeking promotion","As per above, it would be great to do some more skill development in leadership as I have found the recent supervisory training and Gallery team workshop really valuable. &nbsp;I would also like to improve or work on my networking skills so I can continue to build important relationships and make meaningful long-lasting&nbsp;connections with my work.&nbsp;Another area I would really like to learn further in, that would involve training, is Cultural Competence Training.

While this might not be my own personal development plan, this will be our&nbsp;prime focus for me and my family within the next two years (hopefully sooner). The reason this is relevant is because this ties into our&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;plans (potentially within the next 5 years),&nbsp;and all activities in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;From a personal perspective, I&#39;d be more than happy to continue growing and learning within Stakeholder Engagement. I would like to reach a level where I feel confident in every situation and have a good understand how to action/resolve&nbsp;each problem - I try to work on this every&nbsp;day. I think this can easily be achieved simply by surrounding myself in different projects and with repetition, potentially with&nbsp;further studies or IAP2 training.&nbsp;I would also like to reach a point where I feel&nbsp;confident to review my&nbsp;current Position Description (PD) to reflect my contributions within Stakeholder Engagement so that I&#39;m not classified as a &#39;Customer Service Rep&#39;. (ie. going up levels).&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get better at time management, project management, problem solving, marketing, and&nbsp;networking within the town (internally &amp; externally).&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of me would like to get into a&nbsp;creative space again, however I do not know what that truly looks like. Since starting my small local business, I have found a spark for &#39;creating&#39; again -&nbsp;I&#39;ve been enjoying the designing, photography &amp; videography aspects of the business and could easily see myself doing this as a career. Stakeholder Engagement has also contributed to this each time I have gone out to get project update photos for Have Your Say - it might not seem like a&nbsp;creative activity, however it is something I take pride in and enjoy. Unfortunately this type of career change would be harder&nbsp;to achieve as this would require some form of study / learning program and time is restrict enough as it is, however I will not rule this out as an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for this to become realistic, wifey &amp; I would need to both be working comfortably and ideally Willow would need to be at school as daycare is not an option. (Night school or off-campus study would also work).&nbsp;&nbsp;3-4 Year Plan: Both parties (Kim &amp; I) working full time with&nbsp;Willow at school, making study / workshops / personal development freely available whilst two incomes are steadily&nbsp;flowing.&nbsp;If still within&nbsp;Council, &#39;climb&nbsp;the ladder&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Potentially look at secondments and work in other departments&nbsp;for further exposure, development and understanding just as I have done since start at Council. I enjoy mixing it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;5+ Year Plan: Personally I find it hard to think about what 5 Years time will look like, however eventfully I would like to go into full-time business, whether that be clothing, printing services, collectables, or something else creative I would ultimately like to call it &#39;my own&#39;. All of these things are currently hobbies that I do on a daily basis, however hopefully one day, one of these hobbies will flourish into something&nbsp; bigger. I can not hide the fact that I love the &#39;hustle&#39; and do entrepreneurial things however I have come to terms that there is a lot of risk involved with doing these activities full-time / steadily, which is why Council will remain in the equation for as long as possible / long as it needs to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I find that these &#39;dreams&#39; are not achievable or realistic by this time in life, I would be content with remaining in Council (government) due to the steadiness and&nbsp;consistency. However by this point I would like to have achieved the following:&nbsp;- Some form of study to compliment my career and/or personal choices.&nbsp;- Exposure to management within a role&nbsp;- Confident in high level problem solving&nbsp;- Be higher up than a level 3&nbsp;haha.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Soz Hannay, my&nbsp;IDP might be the messiest one in Council but hopefully I&#39;ve given you enough to work on something).&nbsp;","Looking for a career change outside of role, Seeking promotion, Remain in current role",- Some form of study to compliment my career and/or personal choices.&nbsp;- Exposure to management / ownership within a role.- Confident in high level problem solving.&nbsp;- Move up in levels.&nbsp;,Other,Catch up whenever milestones are achieved to re-evaluate plans.&nbsp;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

aod,Yes,Annie Doherty,Collections Services Officer,Townsville City Council,Community Environment & Lifestyle,Community & Lifestyle,Libraries,,Coordinator Operations & Resources (Shan Boller),Pending Review,10-01-2023, - ,No,"I fixed long entrenched errors with the serials, using an understanding developed through a combination of learning from others, and my own experimentation and problem solving. I identified that previous fixes for the errors did not address the root of the problem and that we needed a solution for the main cause of all the errors. As the serials were greatly neglected when I came into this role, and with very little serials knowledge or experience in the new team, I am proud of what I learned and how hard I worked to fix the errors and get it functioning properly.&nbsp;I consistently contributed to the Riverway collections working group and put in a lot of hard work with the Thuringowa closure, often working autonomously to collect data, make decisions, and weed a huge amount of items. &nbsp;I developed and delivered several training sessions for new staff regarding the collection. &nbsp;I trained several staff members and work experience students in areas such as courier, bulk loan selections and delivery, serials, circulation tasks, and shelving. &nbsp;I presented to the GM at a meeting. &nbsp;I provided a consistently high level of customer service, both on the floor and in my role when talking to bulk loan customers and purchasing item requests. &nbsp;I helped organise the Share the Dignity donations &nbsp;I figured out how to activate an RFID tag without having to catalogue an item for use on the board games for after-hours activities. Discovered that RFID tags do not work on iPads. This was done to provide a service for the L&amp;I team. &nbsp;Worked with the team to create new processes and written procedures such as handling the Iron Mountain items, a spreadsheet for re-ordering items while on the floor, how to fix common issues with serials. &nbsp;Led the weeding and transfer of collections such as home service stack, large print and YA manga.&nbsp;Worked to make sure bulk loan selections were always done on time. &nbsp;Catalogued several books myself, which involved downloading or creating a record from scratch, adding holdings, choosing a Dewey number, creating a spine label, and sending it to Michelle to process. Sparked lots of great conversations in the team about where items belong in our collection and why. &nbsp;Created and deployed several Facebook and Instagram posts to promote the collection. Generated Facebook stats each month for the business development planning officers. &nbsp;Uploaded and maintained the digital screens in each of the branches. &nbsp;Worked to maintain the catalogue by deleting lost items, refreshing popular items, organising series, uploading and editing MARC records, and actioning high demand item reports. ","I consistently speak up, contribute and give feedback in meetings or when working in a team. I am also good at listening to others, considering other points of view and taking on feedback.&nbsp;I am good at written communication and will always lend a hand to proofread for a colleague or help write a procedure, a powerpoint, toolbox, etc. &nbsp;I am good at decision making and considering the long-term outcomes of decisions. &nbsp;I am honest and diligent which makes me reliable and trustworthy when working in a team. &nbsp;I make an effort to communicate what I am doing or what I&rsquo;m working on so that my team is on the same page. &nbsp;I am good at problem solving and seeing a task or problem through to completion. ","Goal: to become skilled at BAU tasks and able to spend more time on projects as a team.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality: majority of time is currently spent working individually on BAU tasksor searching for something to do with no direction.&nbsp;Obstacles: CS shifts, having to work across branches, difficulty finding an efficient way to allocate BAU tasks, difficulty communicating or a lack of &lsquo;checking in&rsquo; with team, and the learning curve that the team is still undergoing.Options: Having a schedule for when team members will be at Aitkenvale, finding a tool to fairly allocate tasks that works for everyone, a consistent daily check in with the team, and taking the time to teach one another and share the tasks so that everyone has the same knowledge and can practice it. &nbsp;Way forward: team building workshops, getting to know how each other work and communicate, asking other team members for help and offering my help to them to facilitate team work.&nbsp;&nbsp;The above goal is for the next 1-2 years, after that I would like to focus on promoting the collection, in particular&nbsp;reader&rsquo;s advisory where we can help children, teens and adults find content that is relevant to them.

I believe I have done incredibly well in my time here and I am proud of my efforts and proud that I can teach new people off my own work.

I would like to challenge myself in the next five years. Learning new information and skills excites me and makes the workplace an enjoyable, learning environment. I would also like to achieve more leadership skills and be able to lead a team. This would be a great opportunity to build more confidence and have more responsibilities. I believe I am more than capable of taking on other responsibilities and a higher workload. I would also like to extend my education and qualifications. Gaining more qualifications allows me to gain more skills and have career movements across council roles.","Develop/ expand in current role, Secondment opportunities, Looking for a career change outside of role, Move sideways (explore working in different team)","My learning and development goals are to obtain more certificates and training that council can offer to challenge myself and allow myself more opportunities to work and learn in other council areas. The steps I need to take would be to be in touch with my supervisor and the Qualifications team to see what is available for me. I would like to complete a Certificate IV Business. I believe this is the right time for me to undergo this training as I can now confidently say that I can cover anyone in the team&rsquo;s role if they were away. This means I have nothing further to learn, just to get better and faster in the systems, which I&rsquo;m doing every day. Long-term wise, I hope this training allows me different opportunities to extend my knowledge and personal growth as a young employee. The time frame for this goal is ideally a year, if not two to gain another certificate.","occasional (e.g., once, or twice a year) â€˜skip levelâ€™ meetings where the manager from 2-3 levels higher (General Manager, Director, CEO) meets with employees, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly team meetings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter was originally a role that my team leader was responsible for, however upon realising I had capacity where he did not, I opted to absorb this into my own role. I am extremely proficient in my own position, confidently making decisions that can financially impact some of Townsville&rsquo;s most disadvantaged ratepayers. I have recently begun to branch out and begin completing the Supplementary Run reports; although I have only done this once so far, I hope to take this responsibility on for the foreseeable future to grow my knowledge and confidence and feel as though I am contributing more in such a stressful period.","I am quite literally the correspondence queen within my team and am often called upon to help construct or review letters and emails. I have excellent recall and can often remember exactly what I did on a property and why just by hearing the address or surname. I am always eager to put my hand up to learn new skills or assist in other areas of the team when I have the capacity to do so, which also expands my knowledge of the different positions. I bring an air of sass and humour to the team and really aim to keep them on their toes in both the best and worst ways.","In the next five years I hope to have rotated through all Billing Officer positions and have a much stronger understanding of everything that goes into our Rates, especially the charges aspect. I would like to explore charges more to prepare for assisting in Rates weekends, as I feel this is a task that should be shared around. However, in saying this I would like to see the implementation of pay banding to encourage retention. I thoroughly enjoy this job and my team, however feel that the current pay structure does not accurately reflect the skills, knowledge, and responsibility that comes with every passing year. Pay banding from level 3 to level 4 would create an incentive to remain within the position, and if the last year has taught Council anything, it&rsquo;s that retention is highly important within this team. I also don&rsquo;t believe it to be fair that a new starter doing less than half of their role, with a very limited understanding of the position, should be receiving a very similar pay to other members of the team who work diligently, have significantly more experience and knowledge, and take on higher workloads with more responsibility.

I have also gathered a lot of knowledge on workplace health and safety due to becoming a Health and Safety Representative&nbsp;in my work team. This is things like learning about the workplace health and safety act and what it consists of and how to apply those practices to my everyday work. With this also comes the task of taking on any health and safety issues that my fellow workmates may encounter and reporting them to the safety committee. One example that I have brought up is the fire-retardant shirts that we wear for work. I have trial ran multiple different shirts and found the best one for my&nbsp;work team to wear.,"Some strengths that I have brought to my role and work team&nbsp;is trying to keep team morale high by helping whoever I can whenever I can.&nbsp;For example, pulling&nbsp;someone&nbsp;aside&nbsp;when they may seem down and talking to them about anything they may be having trouble with at the time and helping them in any way that I can. I also keep good preparation&nbsp;with jobs that I may be doing on site by thinking about what my workmate may need next for their job and having it ready and useable by the time they&#39;re on to their next step in the work.

a8m,Yes,Abdullah Mamun,Senior Stormwater Infrastructure Engineer,Townsville City Council,Infrastructure & Operations,Engineering & Asset Infrastructure Plan,Tech & Asset Plan Civil & Open Space,,Principal Lead Stormwater (Ray Wong),Reviewed, - ,09-02-2023,Yes,"As a newcomer of 3 months, I already have gained a very good knowledge and understanding about my job scope and areas of work in TCC. I have familiarised myself with the infrastructure and that relevant systems that collect and monitor the rainfall and water level data within Townsville City Council. I have physically visited some of the key recording stations to know about their conditions and relevant issues and also participated in the annual inspection program to some of the gauging stations with the BOM team. I have identified several maintenance issues and helped our unit to raise work orders to conduct the maintenance work. I have also organised purchase order to install a Transducer at Black Weir at Ross River which will be used to monitor low water levels during the draught season. As a system administrator to the TARDIS and Enviromon I regularly check the communication of the gauging stations with the server to maintain a smooth operation. I generate report with rainfall and water level records after any heavy incidents and distribute them to several key personnel within the council for their information.Besides overseeing the hydrological network, I am also involved in two flood studies currently being undertaken by the Council. I was involved in the tender evaluation for the proposals submitted by the consultants for those two studies and now actively following up with the work activities. I am also trying to familiarise myself with the flood models available within the council and have been practicing the TUFLOW Model to improve my modelling skill. I am also included in the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group (TLDMG) and attended several meetings, training, road show and drill programs at LDCC for the preparedness for upcoming monsoon season. I have also reviewed a report on Gap Analysis and Market Assessment report for Total Flood Warning System for the City Council which is currently being undertaken by the Strategic Infrastructure Planning Unit.","I possess&nbsp;a vast experience in water resources engineering and management particularly in the field of surface water hydrology, integrated river basin management, flood forecasting modelling and flood mitigation process, urban drainage and stormwater management, river restoration and water quality improvement. I also have experience in managing&nbsp;Mega infrastructure development projects, dealing with federal and state government, community engagement and customer&nbsp;handling, contract administration, etc. All of these&nbsp;experiences and skills are my great strength to support my current role and sharing some of these experiences will definitely bring benefits and values to the team.","Before joining this role, I used to work with a leading consultant in overseas in a similar tropical environment, where I used to lead the division dealing with water resources Engineering and management. My professional role always excites me, and I just don&#39;t limit my expertise within my workspace rather I want to utilise it everywhere to build a better and sustainable environment around us for everybody. I found Townsville is a conducive place for me and my current role in TCC provides me the opportunity to achieve my goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to become a Professional Chartered Registered Engineer in Australia for which I have already started the processes and completing the steps soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my personal life, my only daughter has grown up&nbsp;and got married who lives in Sydney with her husband. I live with my wife in Townsville, and we think if needed, we will be more than happy to volunteer our our spare time for City Council for the purpose of any social or community engagement.","Develop/ expand in current role, Secondment opportunities, Move sideways (explore working in different team), Seeking promotion, Research position/career options",I am always very keen to learn new things and venture on new R&amp;D projects. If given the opportunity I would like to have more intense training on TUFLOW modelling and GIS Software to improve my hydraulic modelling skill. I would also like to have training on waterRide software that currently operates the flood forecasting system in TCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very much interested to be actively involved with the newly proposed Total Flood Warning System for Townsville. My previous experience and skills in flood forecasting modelling will definitely add value to this system.&nbsp;,"weekly, fortnightly, or monthly team meetings, lunch and learns for informal discussions about new ideas and strategies, occasional (e.g., once, or twice a year) â€˜skip levelâ€™ meetings where the manager from 2-3 levels higher (General Manager, Director, CEO) meets with employees, regular group emails or online communication",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hindsight, applying for the position was not very well thought out and I&nbsp;have realised that remaining in CMO POSE is a better career move for the meantime.&nbsp; Once I have gained enough experience, I would like the chance to be able to &quot;test&quot; out the waters in the Project Administration space - weather that be 1 day a week or something similar.&nbsp;I have really enjoyed my time in TCC and are motivated to get tasks done, I think this is because there are alot of requests coming through and there always seems to be&nbsp;something to do. I am enjoying the Finance side of things also. Even when we are a few people down - I thrive on organised chaos!&nbsp;The team have been really supportive, especially when I ask lots of questions. They all handle the questioning extremely well and when a new team member comes in, I hope to be able to approach the questions and situations in the same calm and informative manner.&nbsp;One of the most important aspects of the role that I would like to improve on is learning and retaining all the &quot;background&quot; information so I can do my job more effectively (this will take time and experience, but I am working towards it slowly)&nbsp;Such as, the schedules, basic knowledge on all other departments and their roles and when to refer to them, basic arboricultural&nbsp;practices, specific intervention levels etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Develop/ expand in current role, Seeking promotion, Secondment opportunities, Move sideways (explore working in different team)","Goal: Successfully get a permanent role within TCC.I wish to land a permanent role within TCC prior to completion of my current contract (12 months).

It is fulfilling being in a team with likeminded people and I feel like my strengths will contribute a lot to the team dynamic in the future as my determination to complete all my work to a high standard and my resilience to adversity complement each other.

I&rsquo;d like to accept all the courses that council could offer me as I believe its all beneficial to both my professional and personal development. What currently excites me about coming to work is that I&rsquo;m in the industry that I&rsquo;ve been studying to be a part of over the past 4 years.

This is relevant to my long-term objectives as I will be a nationally recognised EHO. If I ever have the desire to move outside of QLD I know that having previously been an EHO in QLD I could easily gain employment elsewhere, this displays the security that this field provides which is a comforting feeling. The time frame of this goal is 2 years, as I start the graduate program in 2023 I would expect that I would achieve this goal in the period of the program or sooner.","nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I still need someone around to supervise/confirm certain things on the bench and even housekeeping (how to wash Hach TN tubes), how to prepare reagents, whether certain samples need to be filtered/diluted&nbsp; or not, etc. I try to stick to housekeeping whenever there is spare time and this has resulted in decluttering the place (cardboard boxes and old stuff in the emergency exit/muffle space, Christmas tree in entrance, etc.) and keeping stock of equipment on the bench up.

I find it easy to adapt to different environments when I have been comfortable and curios, which is very much significant to my position.&nbsp;However, I also believe that communication is a strength of mine when it comes to asking for help and learning opportunities, and communicating when I am not fully understanding.Although I believe I have performed well using my strengths, I believe I have a lot to work on, including bettering my strengths, and acknowledging what my weaknesses are and practicing how to improve my skills, specifically confidence.","I have a strong drive to learn and put my knowledge into practice, so for the next five years I would like to experience taking my traineeship to its full potential, taking the skills I learn and practice and develop them further whether I go to university, or secure a job working in the lab, after my traineeship or upon completion of my degree, Or even applying to complete my certificate 4 in the lab.I am very interested in developing my knowledge in all sides of the process, in the lab as an assistant or out in the field and hopefully one day as a scientist or senior lab tech.I would like to go through my career being flexible and opportunistic and take whatever comes my way with 100% effort and interest. I do have an interest to become knowledgeable and hopefully take on a leadership role in the far future, using my skills to better others and giving back, as I understand not many people are fortunate enough to experience something so involved and hands on.&nbsp;So far, I have experienced this thrill through since my employment with council and lab services. I enjoy coming to work every day to learn and better myself and working towards my future possibly working in this lab (Whenever that may be). I find the environment manageable to work and learn in, and I&nbsp;am excited about learning new test methods and sampling methods, and seeing how different tasks are performed based on people&#39;s perspectives and experience. I can only imagine that my excitement will grow when coming to work in the future as I gain independence and room for even more exciting learning&nbsp;opportunities.","Develop/ expand in current role, Flexible Working Arrangement, Secondment opportunities, Move sideways (explore working in different team), Research position/career options","I want my Learning and Development Goal to be focused on achieving confidence in my individual ability and knowledge. I believe that I will never successfully complete my goal, as learning experiences never end and there is always opportunity to be more knowledgeable and experienced. However, I think progress can be measured over time, however by being resilient and willing to learn confidence will develop in both my skills and knowledge. In order to attain part of my goal I will need to focus on expanding out of my comfort zone, asking questions, listening and be willing to take the opportunities to perform on my own with feedback and targeted practice. I believe my goal can be achieved in all areas inside and outside the lab.I think my goal is realistic because I can achieve as much of my goal as effort I put in and is relevant to my capabilities and position at this time. I believe that by working towards&nbsp;increasing my confidence and&nbsp;my independence I will thrive both currently and in long term aspects. My goal has an infinite time frame, however specifically focusing on the 1-2 years I will be completing my traineeship. I will be able to achieve aspects of my goal integrating hands on experience and online learning, as well&nbsp;as interaction with others who are still learning and experienced. My best possible chance at achieving this goal to its full potential would be exposure to being independent, whilst being guided through. I will however take full ownership when applying myself to achieve confidence and independence and make use of my supervisors for help and guidance.","regular team â€˜stand upâ€™ or â€˜check insâ€™ in-person or online (or both), nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe that is because it was a team already with a good culture.","I believe I am easy to work with, approachable and willing to put my hand up to support the wider team. When required, I have offered to proofread/check others&#39; work to ensure multiple sets of eyes can check for correctness and clarity. As I become more familiar with Council processes I expect I will be more able to support the team in other ways. My strengths are likely that I am organised, a good writer and willing to help out.","This role is a 12-month contract, so my focus at this point is to become familiar with Council processes so I can best deliver for my portfolio. So far, I very much enjoy coming to work - the team has a good culture, is supportive and helpful and bands together when things need to get done. I see this as a very good work environment in which to grow and thrive.","Remain in current role, Develop/ expand in current role, Flexible Working Arrangement, Move sideways (explore working in different team)","To support my performance in this local government role, I would be interested in doing an IAP2 Certificate in Public Participation course. However, at this point in time we have very much hit the ground running and my focus remains on learning Council processes to best deliver work.","nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was able to develop an understanding of the processes quickly which has led me to be able to assist my team through a busy period of work. Moving forward, I hope to develop my skills and knowledge further to be able to perform my role successfully and to assist my team in providing quality design to the community.","I believe I am a creative, and detail-oriented individual with the ability to find&nbsp;innovative ways to complete design tasks, which is crucial for my role as part of the design team.&nbsp;I am also an adaptable person, with willingness to give anything a go. I am always open to giving new designs tasks a go because it means that I get to learn new things, and therefore develop as a graphic designer.","As I progress with my professional career,&nbsp;I would like to remain in my current role and be able to perform my duties to a high standard. Being only quite young in my career, I am continuously looking for ways to develop my skills and knowledge in a range of design areas. I believe I will be able to do this through on-the-job experience, learning from those above me and from formal training.","Remain in current role, Develop/ expand in current role","To be able to develop my skills to further my design knowledge, I think it would be beneficial&nbsp;to attend a design conference. Having heard from my peers the benefits of attending one, I think that it could play a big part in my role moving forward. If this is something achievable and is agreed upon, I would be happy to wait to action this until I have settled into my role more. For example, &#39;The Design Conference&#39; in Brisbane that will be held in June, 2024. I think this would be an inspiring and informative experience that will allow me to learn more about the design world from industry leading creatives and how to incorporate the information into my role.&nbsp;","nothing further, I feel supported by my manager/supervisor and/or we already practice the above supports, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly team meetings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
