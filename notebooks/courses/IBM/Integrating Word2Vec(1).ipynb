Additionally, you'll explore the GloVe model, and an **optional** summary will be provided to enhance your understanding of its application in natural language processing.\n","## GloVe (Optional)\n","\n","\n","\n","GloVe, on the other hand, is another popular algorithm for learning word embeddings. It stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. Unlike word2vec, which is based on predicting context/target words, GloVe focuses on capturing the global word co-occurrence statistics from the entire corpus. It constructs a co-occurrence matrix that represents how often words appear together in the text. The matrix is then factorized to obtain the word embeddings. For example, if \"Man\" and \"King\" co-occure many times, their vectors will be simialr.\n","\n","The GloVe model follows a fundamental approach by constructing a large word-context co-occurrence matrix that contains pairs of (word, context). Each entry in this matrix represents the frequency of a word occurring within a given context, which can be a sequence of words. The objective of the model is to utilize matrix factorization techniques to approximate this co-occurrence matrix. The process is illustrated in the following diagram:\n","\n","1. Create a word-context co-occurrence matrix: The model begins by generating a matrix that captures the co-occurrence information of words and their surrounding contexts. Each element in the matrix represents how often a specific word and context pair co-occur in the training data.\n","\n","2. Apply matrix factorization: Next, the GloVe model applies matrix factorization methods to approximate the word-context co-occurrence matrix. The goal is to decompose the original matrix into lower-dimensional representations that capture the semantic relationships between words and contexts.\n","\n","3. Obtain word and context embeddings: By factorizing the co-occurrence matrix, the model obtains word and context embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations that encode the semantic meaning and relationships of words and contexts.\n","\n","To accomplish this, you can usually begin by initializing WF (Word-Feature matrix) and FC (Feature-Context matrix) with random weights.You will then perform a multiplication operation between these matrices to obtain WC' (an approximation of WC), and assess its similarity to WC. This process is repeated multiple times using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the error(WC'-WC).\n","\n","Once the training is complete, the resulting Word-Feature matrix (WF) provides you with word embeddings or vector representations for each word(the green vector in the diagram). The dimensionality of the embedding vectors can be predetermined by setting the value of F to a specific number of dimensions, allowing for a compact representation of the word semantics.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-AI0205EN-SkillsNetwork/matrix%20fact.png\" alt=\"Co-occurence matrix\" class=\"bg-primary\" width=\"600px\">\n","\n","The key advantage of GloVe is that it can incorporate both global statistics and local context information. This results in word embeddings that not only capture the semantic relationships between words but also preserve certain syntactic relationships.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7b7c6817-92b4-4be3-aa8c-e9cb99767754","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create and train word2vec models\n","Now it's time to get your hands dirty.

In the Skip-gram model, the goal is to predict the surrounding words (context) given a central word (target). The main idea behind this model is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.  Consider this example:\n","\n","**I was little bit taller,**\n","\n","Assuming a context window size of 2, the words in red represent the context, while the word highlighted in blue signifies the target:\n","\n","**<span style=\"color:red;\"> I was</span> <span style=\"color:blue;\">little</span> <span style=\"color:red;\">bit taller, </span>**\n","\n","### Window the Skip-gram:\n","\n","Training the Skip-gram model using the actual context can be computationally expensive. This is because it involves predicting probabilities for each word in the vocabulary for each position in the context as opposed to CBOW that predicts the probabilities for each word in the vocabulary for the target word only. To mitigate this, several approximation techniques are employed.\n","\n","One common approximation technique is to break the full context into smaller parts and predict them one at a time. This not only simplifies the prediction task but also helps in better training as it provides multiple training examples from a single context-target pair.\n","\n","### Using the first row of the table as an example:\n","\n","\n","For the example above the target word is **\"little\"**. The full context for this target word is:\n","**I was bit taller**\n","\n","In the approximation, instead of using the full context to predict the target, you should break it down. There are four approximations in this example:\n","1. Approximation 1: **I**\n","2. Approximation 2: **was**\n","3. Approximation 3: **bit**\n","4. Approximation 4: **taller**\n","\n","For each approximation, the Skip-gram model would aim to predict the target word \"little\" using just that part of the context. This means, for the first approximation, the model will try to predict \"little\" using only the word \"I\". For the second approximation, it will try using only the word \"was,\" and so on.\n","\n","In conclusion, the Skip-gram model aims to understand word relationships by predicting the context from a given target word.
