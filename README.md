## Important Security Notice for `myflaskapp`

The applications within the `myflaskapp` directory, specifically `hello-world-1` and `upstox-data-loader-1`, require access to the Upstox API. Previously, these applications may have contained hardcoded authorization codes. This has been updated for improved security.

**Required Environment Variables for `myflaskapp`:**

To run these applications, you now need to set the following environment variables:

*   `client_id`: Your Upstox API client ID.
*   `client_secret`: Your Upstox API client secret.
*   `BUCKET` (for `hello-world-1`): The Google Cloud Storage bucket name for storing data.
*   `bucket_name` (for `upstox-data-loader-1`): The Google Cloud Storage bucket name. (Consider unifying this to `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` across apps).
*   `UPSTOX_AUTH_CODE`: This is a temporary authorization code obtained from the Upstox login flow. It's used to generate an access token. You'll typically get this code as a query parameter to your `redirect_uri` after a user authorizes your application.
*   `UPSTOX_REDIRECT_URI` (recommended): While not explicitly used in all functions after the change, it's a standard part of the OAuth flow and should be configured.

**How to Obtain `UPSTOX_AUTH_CODE`:**
The `UPSTOX_AUTH_CODE` is generated by Upstox after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes your application. It is sent as a parameter to the `redirect_uri` you configured with your Upstox app. This code is short-lived and needs to be exchanged for an `access_token`.

**Example `.env` structure for `myflaskapp` (do NOT commit actual .env files):**
```
client_id=YOUR_UPSTOX_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_UPSTOX_CLIENT_SECRET
BUCKET=your-gcs-bucket-for-hello-world
bucket_name=your-gcs-bucket-for-data-loader
UPSTOX_AUTH_CODE=TEMPORARY_CODE_FROM_REDIRECT
UPSTOX_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-redirect-uri.com/callback
```

By using environment variables, we avoid exposing sensitive credentials directly in the codebase. Ensure these variables are set securely in your deployment environment.

## Important Security Notice for `poisnous_mushrooms`

The Streamlit application within `poisnous_mushrooms/app/stream/` connects to a backend prediction API. Previously, the URL for this API was hardcoded. This has been updated for improved security and configurability.

**Required Environment Variable for `poisnous_mushrooms/app/stream/`:**

*   `PREDICTION_API_URL`: The full URL to the FastAPI `/predict` endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/predict` or `https://your-deployed-api.com/predict`).

**Example `.env` structure for `poisnous_mushrooms` (do NOT commit actual .env files):**
```
PREDICTION_API_URL=https://your-prediction-api-endpoint.com/predict
```

Ensure this environment variable is set in the environment where the Streamlit application is deployed.
