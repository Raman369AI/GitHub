Tasty Protein,"I've tried numerous protein powders over the years, but none compare to the deliciousness and satiety of this protein powder. Not only does it deliver a punch of protein to my drinks, but it also leaves me feeling satisfied and energized for hours. The taste is incredible, with a rich and creamy flavor that makes each sip a delight. What sets this protein powder apart is its filling nature ��� it keeps hunger at bay, making it an ideal choice for post-workout recovery or as a meal replacement. Plus, it mixes effortlessly into my favorite beverages without any gritty texture or aftertaste. If you're looking for a protein powder that's both tasty and filling, look no further ��� this one is a game-changer!",20-Mar-24,Mo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG6ZASKZAXIIRM7X4JSYZDLTW6VA,TRUE,the United States,0,0,7,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'Decadent chocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
"Finally, A Protein Meal Replacement Shake I Can Feel Good About!","Well, I like to use protein, meal replacement shakes to help supplement my eating. I always have to be mindful of my weight because of genetics and also age (I'm 46, and the weight doesn't come off as easy as it used to). Anyway, I am currently going to the gym 5-6 days a week and am eating a clean diet. I have had a lot of issues with GERD, so I have had to adopt a diet to ensure that no foods or drinks trigger my condition. I also have issues with bladder irritation here and there. When looking for a shake like this, I wanted a shake that was plant protein based and also was healthy...low sugars, probiotics, vitamins, minerals, etc. I have tried Slim Fast, Herbalife, Vemma Bode, GNC Total Lean 25 and always questioned what I was really putting into my body. Most of these shakes tasted like a guilty-pleasure, very sweet but left an after taste. To be truthful, I only lost weight on one...SlimFast. I gained weight with GNC Total Lean 25 and was even watching what I ate and was exercising at the time. Anyway, I did a lot of research on shakes and found that the majority of the people liked Shakeology because of its healthy ingredients. I took a look at the price and had sticker-shock! After doing more research, I found Nature's Bounty Protein Shake Mix. I read that it was very comparable to Shakeology and that it also had helped someone with their GERD issues. I just ordered this flavor and the vanilla for a one-time order to try it out. The canisters are smaller than that of its competitors; however, you can't beat the price and the quality of the product. I know that this review may be premature as I have only had three shakes, since receiving the shipment yesterday morning. However, I have to say that I am already loving this product! I mix it with almond milk and also add some berries, but I have also had the shake without fruit. It tastes great, and there is no chemical after taste. It isn't too sweet either. I have a NutriBullet RX and mix everything in there. Shake comes out great! But that is not what I am so impressed about...I have also been feeling under the weather the past few days. After drinking the shakes, I am actually feeling better and have energy. My stomach is good with regard to the GERD...no complaints there, except for being a little gassy, but this happens when I first start on a product like this until my system adjusts. I just feel better, and it has only been a couple of days. I look forward to seeing if I lose weight with the shake. I am also adding it to my 21 Day Fix Program instead of using Shakeology. So far, I think this product is great! I am not hungry, I feel great, the quality is there and the price is right! I will update this review as I notice any additional benefits or negatives with the product. So far, I recommend it!",15-Mar-16,Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG6QSQ6OAV2O2LTW6MKCSGKKE6WA,TRUE,the United States,0,0,26,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Excellent protein powder,"Protein powder is high quality and contains numerous vitamins and minerals.
It is well sealed with both an outside protective seal and an internal seal. The powder is smooth and can be added to pretty much any liquid. I make it simply with water and have had it both at room temp and after chilled in the freezer. Both are tasty with no residual or chalky taste, there is not a strong chocolate or chemical taste either or any aftertaste. Like any protein powder fruits, veggies or other items can easily be added. Because I am using only water, I simply shake my container for 15-30 seconds and it is well mixed, but a blender may be a better choice if other items are being added to the powder. The powder dissolves easily and completely with simple manual shaking (I just mix it in room temp water with manual shaking for 15-30 seconds in a refillable water bottle).
The amino acid distribution is good and the vitamins and minerals included is impressive. This could be considered both a protein and vitamin supplement.",05-Feb-24,lV,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLDFZSACRX2OE4NMO6QKN6OM5PQ,TRUE,the United States,7,0,8,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'Decadent chocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

This is great by itself with water or milk, or with frozen canned pumpkin or fruits. It���s also great to mix in plain Greek yogurt, it gets really thick like the texture of can frosting and packed full of protein and vitamins.

Hunger-Curbing Protein Shake,"When I first went looking for a protein drink, my main goal was to find a protein powder that was filling, tasted good, and also provided a bit of nutrition. I did quite a bit of research - comparing Slim Fast, ViSalus, and Premier Protein among others. One of my colleagues was nice enough to let me try one of her chocolate Premier protein shakes. After trying it (it had 30 grams of protein - tasted pretty good) I was still hungry after a couple of hours, which was disappointing to me, considering how much protein was in the shake. When I ran across this shake, I was intrigued that it had not only protein, but vitamins and digestive enzymes as well. I was definitely hooked, also when I saw the various reviews stating how delicious and filling the shakes were. I decided to take a chance on these shakes and ordered the decadent chocolate.

A week and a half later, I have been consistently replacing one to two meals a day with two scoops of the protein powder, mixed with two tablespoons of PB2 powdered peanut butter and 8oz - 12 oz unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I mix this together in a blender bottle and it tastes just like a more liquidy peanut butter chocolate milkshake. Mixing the almond milk, PB2, and protein powder, I stay consistently full at work from breakfast until lunch hour - around 4 hours without any hunger pains.

I highly recommend purchasing this shake. I just recently purchased my second container of this powder a couple days ago. Due to the addition of the digestive enzymes and the vitamins, I store the powder in the refrigerator, along with the almond milk. It doesn't say anywhere on the container that you need to do that, but I do it anyway as an added precaution. Also: the powder does come with a scoop in the container. I had to literally dig around in the container to find it, as the powder had buried it, but I eventually found it. If you order this powder, you will not be disappointed. It's definitely a protein powder, but it doesn't taste like one - it is very palatable. You can't go wrong.",08-Jun-14,TiredTwinMom,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGO5IQD4QOJNHQBAWHOIFSVZJIJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,25,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Alternative to Shakeology--Curbs Appetite 4-5 hours,"First of all, Shakeology is expensive as heck! I was looking for a cheaper alternative and this is by far the best protein shake alternative I've ever had. No side effects, and it did take some getting used to. Now, since seriously overweight, my doctor recommended me to do protein shakes for breakfast/lunch, three snacks, and a portion controlled dinner.

This protein shake only offers 15g of protein, and my doctor recommends that I have at least 60g of protein per day. So what I do is double up. I drink two shakes in the morning, two at lunch, and then dinner! When I first started using, I was STARVING. 15g is not going to curb appetite at all! So once I started doubling up, that is when I actually when I saw results. By lunch, I had to force myself to drink the shakes because I was not hungry at all!

Amazon actually accidentally sent me Vanilla when I ordered chocolate, so I can't tell you on the taste. They sell the chocolate flavor at my local Walgreens, so I may just stop there and pick up. I already have another on the way to me and this is so affordable, I'm going to go ahead and stockpile.

I mixed with 2% milk and a banana every time. It is so tasty. Next round I'm going to add some ice, as this shake is super tasty when ice cold.

Weightloss: Because this shake actually curbs my appetite so well, I'm losing 2-4 pounds per week, which I think is great! Some weeks I lose 8 or more pounds, but my loss varies depending on my diet and portion control at dinner. On weekends, I do have a cheat day where I order takeout. I also have a ton of energy from this. I follow this regime with 5 bottles of water and a One Daily women's mult-vitamin.

Side effects: There was some minor gas/bloating the first week, but that has subsided.

This is by far the best weight loss product I've had.",14-Aug-18,Jennifer Moore,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6GY5W5RXTR32324S3CJBISOYYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,27,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Love Love Love this stuff!!,"I absolutely love this stuff! I'm on my 4th week of having this as a breakfast replacement and I've notice so much of a difference in my energy and even lost 5 pounds (not currently doing any exercise to aid). I was never much of a breakfast eater to begin with, but I wanted to boost my metabolism and researched that it's best to start with having breakfast everyday; I was also not getting my daily source of vitamins in the food I was consuming since I don't have the best eating habits. My skin has cleared up so much more and my nails are growing a lot faster and stronger (I've always had very brittle nails and can barely get them to grow w/o breaking). I love that this has all of my daily vitamins needed and many other benefits, such as probiotics, as I've had digestion issues the past several months. My breakfast combo for this is: 2 scoops of the protein/vitamin powder, 1 scoop of PB2 (powdered peanut butter); a handful or so of crushed ice and 8oz. of organic 1% milk; I shake it all up in my Blender Bottle and it's like having a delicious chocolate milk for breakfast; keeps me full for several hours and the taste is great!

The only downfall from ordering this from Nature's Bounty is that it has a purchase limit of 1 per order and you can't order more after a certain amount of time. If you have this everyday as a meal supplement as I do, this technically is only about a 2 week supply. I've signed up for the subscribe and save since I plan to continue using this, but the only option is monthly (1mo, 2mo,3mo+), which doesn't help when I need 2 of these a month. You can't beat the price, though, from it being sold by Nature's Bounty, so separate orders are what I suppose I'll have to do.

"Best Protein For Your Buck, Hands Down.","I originally bought this because, like many here, I was seeking a replacement for Shakeology. I'm a big fan of the Vegan Chocolate Shake-o (for taste, not Vegan designation), but I'd rather not get a second job or take out a second mortgage to afford it. I bought a gaggle of protein shakes in an attempt to find a suitable replacement. Vega One Chocolate was okay, but not the robust chocolate flavor I was looking for, and it had a green tint and got sorta chunky if didn't drink it right away. Yuck. Orgain Organic Meal has a good taste...again, not as chocolate-y as I'd hoped, and still pricey at $60+ for a month's supply.

Enter the winner: Nature's Bounty Chocolate.

People will ask about the price? It's right in my budget. If you watch for deals, you can get this at $8/tub (2 tubs covers a month). Stock up. Nutritionally, it's pretty solid. Less sugar than Shake-o, missing some of the other magic ingredients (ashwaganda, anyone?), but a solid meal replacement that doesn't leave me starving an hour later. The taste? The closest thing I can liken it to is powdered Swiss Miss hot chocolate mix. If I spoon it from a travel container into my shaker cup, I lick the spoon. I've even made it warm...and it tastes pretty good. In my opinion, this stuff doesn't need a bunch of fruit and fancy stuff to make it taste good. I just toss it in with almond milk in my shaker cup and some ice, and I'm golden. It blends well, doesn't leave chunks, all the magic things you're seeking. I've also tried it with spinach, frozen fruit, ginger, all the other awesome smoothie ingredients and it's still pretty bomb.",28-Feb-18,Marla,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHEEI3WURIMHDPUXYMNVL4ACI4PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,4,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Just try it,"I���ve been taking this for YEARS now. I mix with Barlean���s greens chocolate; 30 calories a scoop, Ancient Nutrition chocolate collagen; 20 calories scoop and GoodKarma flax milk 8 ounces, 25 calories (1000mg of omegas in that), garden of life prebiotic fiber also, 20 calories a scoop I think on that one. I periodically mix in L-Theanine & Mushroom blend depending on mood. The days I don���t have my custom shake I feel okay.....but after 2-3 days if I get busy with my kids in the morning and forget suddenly I start getting ��ber sluggish. I have a deficiency of sorts that I can���t pinpoint exactly but whatever my diet is missing it���s in my magic mix LOL I have anxiety disorder also (my entire life from my earliest childhood memories) and anemia, this seems to help both. I hope this helps someone. I���m not a doctor and I���m doing what���s right for me but this may reach someone.

Oh I also have PCOS and the extra fiber helps androgen function. Google this. I didn���t know this and it has truly saved my life. I lost 50 lbs in 2020z Winning! Anyways this product seems cheap but I don���t have any negative side effects.

Delicious Protein Mix for Meal Replacement Shakes,"This stuff smells like sweet vanilla powdered pound cake...
and that's basically what it tastes like as well.
It makes a very tasty shake.
We start with sweet vanilla almond milk as a base,
though you could certainly use cow's milk if you prefer.
(Don't use water... that's just lame, and it produces a low quality result).
Then, we add this powder which provides protein, sweetness, and bulk.
And here's the big secret: we then add FROZEN bananas and berries.
Don't add fresh bananas / fruit because that gives the shake a more
thin and juice-like consistency. If you use frozen bananas, it thickens
the shake so much that you truly do not need to add any ice at all.
The frozen bananas also do not melt rapidly like crushed ice does.
Using frozen bananas or other frozen fruits is almost like adding ice cream
to the mix... making it very thick and sweet.
These shakes, when prepared as described above, are great for a
meal replacement to keep weight under control. They are very filling.

We also tried the chocolate version, to which we add chocolate almond milk,
and frozen bananas (but no other fruit), and that makes a nice change of pace,
and a tasty shake as well. However, the vanilla is a more versatile base to which
a wider variety of frozen fruits can be added.",27-Jul-20,JLJ,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLKAFR3DS2SABEFZ37GB3DZBLGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,2,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}
"I have tried a lot, this is perfect for me.","I was not looking for a meal replacement! I didn't want extra calories and sugar. I was just looking for a liquid way to get vitamins. My body does not seem to pull the nutrients out of food like it should and I'm starting to get health issues. I have been using this stuff for about a week now and am already feeling a bit better. I'm having more energy, sleeping better, and not feeling so achy. I still have a bit of issues, but I will have to let it have more affect on me.
The flavor is good, especially if you let the powder soak a little after mixing and give it a chance to really dissolve. I'm eager to get my blood work done and see how things are looking for me. This drink is low calorie, good vitamins, and I seem able to absorb them. I will post more when I get tested again in a couple months.

UPDATE: I have ordered several containers now. I love that it is low calorie a little more than 100 calorie per 8 oz. I get lots of vitamins with low sugar. The taste is good (I have tried a lot of powders, this is a better one). I feel fairly full on it, because of the protein. I will mix it with water and it will be fine or sometimes I blend it with a smoothie for a meal replacement. Either way good.",20-Aug-19,Melissa Rappleye,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETH4L4ZG5HVLBITYQ6KCZIZQAXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,4,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Good for meal replacements,"Over the summer, I was trying to eat healthier. Keeping track of my food on an App, I noticed that my protein percentages were always lower than they should have been. I bought this for two reasons: one, to increase the amount of protein I had in my daily diet, and two: to use as a breakfast shake to eliminate a meal and hold me over until lunch.

I drank this product religiously for several months. I used 8 ounces of Silk Light Chocolate Milk (to keep the calories down, but when I ran out I COULD drink it with 2% milk, but it was really nasty in comparison) and one scoop of the mix. The weird thing was that the scoop was always half buried under the powder, but I just saved the one from the bottle before until I managed to dig the new one out. I think that with both together, my break fast was somewhere between 150-200 calories, and if I drank it before I went to work at around 7 am, I wasn't hungry until lunch at 12:30.

As mentioned, I wanted to use this to give me a low-calorie meal so I could lose weight. My first year of teaching, I gained something like 20 pounds, and over the summer, I wanted to get rid of that weight. My dad was sure that protein supplements were used by people who wanted to GAIN weight, and I was nervous, but I had read some positive reviews about others who had had success. For me, it was a success. Without doing much exercise, I managed to lose 15 of the 20 pounds in five months.",28-Dec-15,Tomi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAVNSG3C5H6KTVFPCMV2ZPFJ7MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,8,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

If you like chocolate my suggestion is to buy this one for sure. I will follow up in another week or so to update this review regarding the fibre and the collagen to see if there has been any difference for me. I have experienced some hair loss a lot of hair shedding so I wanted to increase my collagen intake and we'll see if I continue to lose hair quickly or not.

Worth the purchase.,"I was worried about trying this because most protein powders make me sick but I am pretty desperate to lose weight so I figured since I loved this brands hair, skin, and nail vitamins I���d try it... I have no real complaints and the flavor is amazing (I mix it with sweetened vanilla almond milk & it tastes like cake batter to me). I do have an energy boost after drinking it but the energy doesn���t last all day, but it definitely has me up and moving all day. I have heart palpitations and coffee or any stimulant increases them but this doesn���t & I really like that I get energy without having that side effect.. I would say if you���re going to order this, be smart and go ahead and order a cup specifically made for protein powder that has the ball into so that it breaks down the way it���s supposed to.. it���s definitely helped me stay full, and definitely helps you remain regular with bathroom habits.. I give this 5 stars without a doubt because I���m also lactose intolerant and this seems not to bother me, whereas other powders do, and it also really tastes amazing.. worth the purchase and after ordering my first one I went ahead and ordered two more. As long as the formula remains the same I see myself being a lifelong customer. So far I have loved all of this brands products that I���ve tried!",16-May-20,AMS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDFRKX3T2ZF5SWPNCZUHO5ODLHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,0,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}

Great tasting!,"First time trying this product. I mixed 10 ounces of coconut almond milk blonde by Khalifa farms, a half cup of frozen pineapple, a half a scoop of green super food by amazing grass, two scoops of the protein shake mix, and half of an over ripe banana. Sprinkled Chia seeds on top and let the mix sit for 15 minutes. It�s important that you let proteins shakes sit at 15 minutes bare minimum because undissolved Protein will make your stomach hurt and gassy!

I do, in fact, I have a very sensitive stomach and this does not cause me any discomfort. I will update if it does. It tasted fantastic and is a very subtle yet smooth vanilla flavor. You could pretty much add any type of fruit to it and it will turn out into a very good consistency without being overly thick. Highly recommend you try this one out.

Keep in mind this is a vitamin and health shake mix, it�s not ice cream!

Excellent product...,"Love the product. I was looking for a ""well rounded"" shake that wasn't just protein and this works great. The biggest thing that I've noticed so far is regular bowel movements and increased digestive activity in general which is great because I'm usually a gassy human and this has straightened that out!

I'm mainly writing this review to say that you'll need to buy some type of shaker like the ""Blender Bottle"" to mix this. Probably day one stuff for the experienced but to the couch potatoes like myself I thought I'd be able to mix it with a spoon and I was wrong. Luckily I found one at the local big box store, but had I known I would've just purchased one with my order. No complaints about flavor here, chocolate milk and vanilla malts, mmm (I mix it with milk instead of water). At this price it's worth trying out and if it does nothing for you then you're only out $10. 13 servings per container so each one will last a couple weeks.

A LIFE SAVER,"While undergoing a large amount of stress, I wasn't able to eat much solid food.
Eventually this triggered my Anorexia to come back despite it being gone for years.

There have been days where I'm unable to eat solid food and I was dropping weight DRASTICALLY!
I was 75lbs and nearly on my death bed and this powder was the ONLY thing I was able to consume. I went through about 3 containers in 2 months.

I chose this because it has a wide variety of vitamins, is gentle on my stomach and tbe probiotic helps my gut health and immune system stay happy.
After this powder being (almost) the only thing I've been consuming - I went to the doctor to get blood work done to see if I was lacking any essential vitamins or nutrients that I could supliment to try to get healthy again.
The blood results came back that I have ALL the Vitamins and Nutrients I need! I feel sooooo much better when I have the power and am able to function. I've been slowly able to increase my intake and now am steadily imporiving and am able to eat again!

I WHOLE HEARTEDLY believe that this powder saved my life when I was on my death bed.

Yummy with almond milk and makes your hair grow!,"I am in my sixties and I have very long (past my shoulders) hair and I want to keep it healthy, keep it growing and thick. I use Nature's Bounty hair vitamins like a daily multiple. I tried this shake mix based on reviews and actually the shake made my nails grow longer, my hair more luxurious and my skin very clear. I seriously think that its all the Biotin in the shake mix which is a lower amount than in the vitamins.
Like other reviewers, I DO NOT mix this with water, but with Double chocolate almond milk, a scoop of FAGE GREEK yogurt and the combined yogurt and mix is about 30 grams of protein. Sometimes I mix things up and add strawberries, Chocolate Ovaltine (more protein), a banana or vanilla flavored FAGE Greek yogurt. This shake becomes my breakfast and I am not hungry again until dinner. I actually slimmed down with the shake and a salad for dinner. I LOVE this stuff-it is really a rich chocolate flavor that you really don't have to add extra chocolate, but I am a chocoholic. I have frozen it mixed with the yogurt and its almost like a rich gelato freeze.
Does this mix make your hair and nails grow? YES! I was surprised and yes,it was the mix, because when I ran out of the mix, my nails went back to their usual break and split selves. I am buying more now because my daughter is starting swim team practice and she needs the extra calories, vitamins and protein. She will probably make it with chocolate milk.

Protein Mix For the Rest of Us,"After spending countless dollars trying countless protein shake mixes on the market, the Optimal Solutions Protein & Vitamin Mix best represents what I've been looking for all along - Tasty shake mix with a hearty amount of protein, and essential vitamins rather than athletic compounds that the average person may or may not really need.

Nature's Bounty has a good reputation for quality vitamins and supplements, so I was tickled to learn that they had formulated the Optimal Solutions powdered mix. My favorite is the Decadent Chocolate, but I like the lighter flavor of the Vanilla on occasion and keep both on hand. I have several health conditions that fare better when I consume more protein, but it's often hard to get the ratio I want without eating lots of meat. And I don't eat beans, either.

Optimal Solutions is indeed the optimal solution for me! I mix it with protein nut milk, a little bit of yogurt, or lactose free milk for swigging a cup throughout the day to get the protein levels I want. The mix blends okay manually, but makes a frothy smooth shake in a heartbeat with a simple blender. Tastes okay if mixed with water and ice, but is really good with milk, yogurt, or fruit.

I go through a canister each month, and price-wise I find it an economical, treat-like option to swallowing vitamin pills. I can wholeheartedly recommend Nature's Bounty Optimal Solutions and the Nature's Bounty product line in general.",17-Aug-17,Susan Cassell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUEQ4PFKXQNJOA3WZ4KL3534P3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,2,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

I love this protein powder!,"This is my first time trying protein powder. I bought both the vanilla and chocolate. I���ve tried the canola for the last 3 weeks. At first it tasted chalky, however I���ve noticed that the longer it is blended in, it actually blends in smoother and it no longer tastes chalky. I use this powder with cashew milk, frozen fruit and frozen bananas and I also add peanut butter powder, as the vanilla taste seemed strange to me in the beginning. I needed to get used to the vanilla taste and as such I add the peanut butter powder. I have noticed that I am very flatulent after I���ve drank the shakes, Therefore persons who may be have an aversion to dairy will need to try this to see if it works. This evening I finally tried the chocolate with the same ingredients used in my shake and I absolutely love it!!! I think I may prefer the chocolate, however adding the peanut butter powder to my shakes make such a big difference, that the taste of the protein powder does not over power.

My personal trainer advised that I should start the protein shakes for energy. It is not for weight loss, as I do still feel quite hungry even when I���ve had the shake.",25-Feb-20,Cotts77,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDCHXUNUFA7WKGBFH655RLUYFXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,0,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}

LOVE THIS SHAKE,"It's definitely the best tasting chocolate protein shake around. Frankly, I don't know what it is about this formula, but it's really good. Love the thinness of the finished shake nomatter how much junk I put in it. I've been a fan of muscle milk and a few other heavy protein shake mixes and chocolate is always good but this one has a better finished texture and a really rich flavor.

Then I ramp it up even more. I make my shakes in a blender, with frozen strawberries with either milk or coconut milk. I like adding a frozen overripe banana sometimes. Sometimes I add a spoon of peanut butter. Also, I always add a packet of sugar free hot chocolate so it's even more chocolatey. (also because I buy the damn things but we always forget we have them so I use them up and they give my shake added calcium and a chocolate boost). (can't have enough chocolate)

They ARE grainy but it doesn't bother me and I don't mind it. Also maybe because they don't get too creamy and take on a lot of air. That's my big complaint about most protein shakes now - the more you blend, the smoother they get but they get too thick, too foamy, too filled with air and when they're done, you have to eat half of it with a spoon. I do not like that. Nature's Bounty doesn't seem to, at least as much as the whey shakes do. That's it. I highly recommend them.",14-May-13,ancient incognito monkey,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWVMXK6PJAYCQNIFIJMV74RF4HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,2,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

"By Far, The Best","I tried all kinds of protein shake mixes over the years. Then a number of years ago I found this at my local pharmacy and tried it. The price, compared to some, is a little more expensive. However, compared to the high-end mixes that are are the rage, this is very inexpensive and, in my opinion, worth every penny. The taste far exceeds the most expensive and highest praised product on the market today. The directions call for two scoops per cup of milk, I find it to be a bit much and am satisfied with one scoop.

It is wonderful by itself or mixed up into other concoctions I have created. For the chocolate, I enjoy making either Peppermint Patties or peanut butter cups. for the former, mix as normal, but add a few drops of peppermint extract. For the latter, I mis as directed and add about half to a teaspoon, depending on taste, of powdered peanut butter. The vanilla mixes well as an apple crisp, recipe obtained from Nature's Bounty site. Or a handful of frozen fruit. I will also take either and mix into some hot coffee, froth the milk and add. I call these Debbie-ccinos.

These mixes are superb and you are not adding things to mask the taste, but to enhance it and create new experiences. Just have fun with it.",04-Feb-17,DL Bach,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGSB2UF5E3DJWCL3P5VA2TOASPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,5,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Great Taste & Great Price,"Trying to loose weight, and found this product. It arrived a couple days after i ordered it. I got the vanilla, as i figured i could always add unsweetened cocoa powder to it, if i wanted chocolate. I use it as my breakfast alternative. The taste is great, and it doesn't taste overly, chalky. I add half a banana, a handful of blueberries, a tablespoon or two of yogurt (depending on how thick and creamy you want your smoothie), a handful or two of cubed ice, and a teaspoon or tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder (depends on how chocolatey you want). Blend good, and voila! I only gave 4 stars; because i thought this would keep me a little fuller, until after lunch. It gets me to lunch, without having to go eat, but i would have like to have that ""Full"" feeling, that carries me a little longer. Not a problem though, i will try adding flax seed to see if that helps. I am very satisfied with this product, and it's price. I intend to keep purchasing it.

***UPDATE*** Now adding 2 tablespoons Flaxseed in the smoothie... My belly feels full. I am not even thinking about lunch, before lunch. I have updated to 5 stars, as this now, is my perfect weigh loss supplement.",20-Mar-18,Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEPDSBZBONEY7MHWJHJDWUEUJJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,26,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}

Great Texture,"I have a sensitive stomach and sensory issues with food. This is the single protein powder that I can actually consume without it making me feel sick in one way or another. I do agree it's a little expensive, but to me it's worth it. I struggle to eat meat, which generally results in my daily protein being very low and this helps to make them a little higher. Also, if it's blended well it's very very similar to chocolate milk in flavor and texture.

"Awesome Product, Comparable to Shakelolgy","I love this protein shake mix! As many others here, I have used Shakeology in the past and loved it, but it was so expensive and hard to commit to long term with such a high price tag. With this shake mix, I can literally buy a almost year's supply with what a month of Shakeology would cost (there was even a ""discount"" I could apply at check-out for this item, so make sure you look for that too). Even though it may not have ALL the nutritional value of Shakeology, it is very close and the price and taste cannot be beat. Shakeology actually has more calories, sugar, and sodium per serving when compared to this (Yeah, I was shocked too!). One thing I have noticed, though, is this does not keep as full for as long as the Shakeology mix did (maybe an hour or so difference, no big deal). The chocolate taste is delicious though! I use a frozen banana, water, and ice, blend for about 30 seconds, and then add this mix in and blend another 30 seconds. Perfect, smooth, delicious breakfast smoothies every time! I drink it every morning.

As a note, I used Shakelogy for my first found of 21-day fix, and am using this replacement for my second round of 21-day fix. So far, my results have been the same as the first time around which is awesome!",02-Jan-16,Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBQ73LOUCI3Q3F2FOZ4W6U7RNGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,1,5 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Great taste and texture. Filling. Try it with Almond Milk,"Great taste, quality product. Great meal replacement. Try it with Vanilla Almond Milk, I think that mixes better than cow milk, and it's hard to imagine many that won't enjoy it - and (unless you get unsweetened milk) you won't feel the need to sweeten it or cover what often is a gritty or bitter protein product with fruit or other sugary stuff. It's talc powder fine - enough that I just use a shaker glass with a wire ball and so it's lightning fast to get it down, so that's great for breakfast and I can easily skip lunch if need be on a busy day with minimal hunger, or at least get to lunch without snacking - difficult in my office full of women who like to cook. Good balance on the nutritional side. I do see that there is some oat fiber in it now, so if you are truly a celiac patient then that will carry a little risk for you (ignore this all of you who are just on a gluten free kick - Oat has minimal (more like negligible) gluten, and most of that is from sharing processing equipment with wheat mills). Bottom line, this is a quality product, there is not the usual smell or unpalatable issues I've seen with most other protein powders. I think they have worked hard on getting the balance right with this product.",10-Jun-15,J.

I'm picky and this is yummy!,"I bought this to use in a smoothie and I was hesitant because I never like the taste of protein powders. They always seem to taste artificial or sickeningly sweet. Now I haven't had this powder plain, just mixed with water. Instead, I mix it into a smoothie with fruit, almond milk, peanut butter, and spinach. It adds just the right amount of chocolate flavor, is not overpowering, and doesn't make the smoothie too sweet.

"Amazing price, flavor, and quick results-- if combined with workouts and a healthy diet!","This is my new bae!
I got this as a Shakeology and breakfast alternative to keep me full before lunch. I am 16 weeks postpartum, and desperately trying to lose 18 lbs. I'll have to wait and see since I literally just got it. It tastes nasty with water though, so definitely try it with almond milk! I only use a scoop with 8 oz of almond milk.

This one in particular is excellent. I read that some use almond milk,"I have only recently begun drinking these protein shakes, but I am hooked. This one in particular is excellent. I read that some use almond milk, but I've also had a good result using water with half a cup of oatmeal flakes to help thicken it. With a banana, oatmeal, fresh blueberries, this is a healthy breakfast alternative to the bacon-egg-biscuit from the drive through! Plus, I am loving the convenience. I make two of these at bedtime, and pop them in the freezer. The next morning, I set them on the counter while getting ready for work. I drink one on the way, put one in the freezer at work, taking it out early enough to thaw for a mid-afternoon ""lunch."" So, these are two meal replacements for me. I'm not a nutritionist, so I can't say this is the proper intake of the vitamins, proteins, etc., but I can say that I feel like a new woman -- I have more energy, am sleeping better at night, not as many hot flashes, better mood, just better all around!

Yummy chocolate shake mix! Very happy!- Watch Price Though!!!,"Finally, a chocolate protein shake that is YUMMY without me having to add stuff to it!! I've tried a lot of chocolate protein powders. They are ""OK"" and I tend to add things to them like PB2, etc. I got the chocolate Nature's Bounty in the mail and could tell it was different even based on the texture of the powder. I've been using it for 3-4 months now and love it. It sort of reminds me of Carnation Instant Breakfast as far as the taste goes. I put it in a Contigo Shake & Go shaker (TJ Maxx $8) or other shaker container and it mixes well. It does NOT mix well with a spoon (it's clumpy). I have tried it with skim milk, water (not so great), and now I'm doing half skim milk half water and it works well too.
HOWEVER, watch the PRICE. It was an add-on after xmas for just under $10. Meijer also had it buy one get one free which brought their price down to $8ish each. Amazon is asking $18-19 now and that's ridiculous. I guess I'll run out for awhile because that is TOO HIGH. I will buy several if I see the price below $10 again.

Five Stars,"I love this stuff! I have tried several other protein powders, and while there are many out there with more protein, I always end up forcing myself to use them because they are chalky and not up to snuff. This one actually tastes like a delicious chocolatey shake! I usually use it as a meal replacement, and it actually keeps me full and satisfied for a while and I always look forward to it, because it makes me feel like I am having a special treat. I keep it pretty simple (I took this idea from a previous reviewer and tweaked it ever so slightly): 2 scoops chocolate protein powder, 1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and 1 frozen banana whipped up in the blender. Or I will take out half the banana and add a tablespoon of nut butter. Both versions are under 300 calories.

You could also keep it simple and just mix it with water or your favorite milk. Or try another variation of smoothie. So many options, but it's always going to be delicious if you use this!

If you like Stevia you'll probably LOVE this,"The thing is I'm not a huge fan of Stevia. It has that bitter taste and you can clearly tell it's sweetened with Stevia, but it's not bad. I'm going to finish the rest of the product because it's good, but it's not something I want to pay for again and it's only because of the strong Stevia flavor. It also **Kind Of** taste chalky but maybe that's the Stevia I'm tasting

When I first got this I tried mixing this with *only water* and couldn't finish it. However mixing it with milk was absolutely fine. I drink it 1-2 times a day and it's helping me get through a head-cold. I blend this with a Ninja blender and there's no chunks for me. This keeps me full for about 2-3 hours.

All in all, this is a great tasting shake especially if you love Stevia. And it's a fair price, so I would say to try it.

**Edit** After about a week I didn't mind the flavor of the Stevia at all anymore. I actually liked the taste of the shake. It's delicious to me now. Would I buy it again?

I Really Love This Product!,"I have maintained a healthy, primarily plant-based diet for several years, but realized I wasn't getting enough protein. Some years ago, my fitness-trainer daughter was a Beach Body rep, and introduced me to Shakeology, which was great, but costly! This protein shake has a similar taste, and it seemed to increase my energy level immediately. Since it was so effective, I reordered two more containers asap. I'm not an Amazon Prime member, and the order I placed on 6/14/2017 wouldn't arrive until 6/24/2017! While waiting for that order, I ended up purchasing a raw vegan brand from a local retailer, containing 23 grams of protein per serving, but my energy level was not the same. Several drug and grocery stores in our area carry Nature's Bounty supplements, but none of them have the protein shake in store.

I found my perfect shake!,"I really love this shake! I spent way too much money on Shakeology for more a year but was tired of plunking down $130 a month. I found out there were other similar shakes on the market, so I started trying some. I always looked for ones that are rated well by customers. The first one I tried got thick but was rather tasteless. Then I tried Cote D'Voire, and it tasted good, but was very thin. If I put enough ice in it to thicken it up, it got rather weak-tasting, too. This week I tried Nature's Bounty, and, wow! It's good! and it's thick and creamy! Yum! I put two servings of fruit and one of vegetables in my morning shake-half a banana, a half-cup of berries or pineapple, and as much spinach or kale as I can cram into the smoothy machine and add some dried peanut butter. This shake tastes like a real chocolate shake I ordered from Dairy Queen or something with chocolate, peanut butter and banana (I used to drink stuff like that and not gain weight!), but this whole thing has, like, 200 calories and is GOOD FOR ME.",09-Mar-17,M.

Returning customer,"Update: The not terrible but not very exciting chocolate taste to this protein powder had me avoiding it for several days. I starting looking for another protein powder that would get me excited to drink in the morning. The one I was looking at is roughly $20 something with shipping adding up to almost $30 something. I was thinking so hard on how much I didn���t want to spend this much money on another possible fail of a protein powder that cost $40 or more. I looked at my hardly touched nature���s bounty complete protein & vitamin shake mix and thought ���how can you make this more exciting and taste worthy for you to crave it in the morning without the sugars of tons of fruit?��� I didn���t need to be overly sweet. The sweetness was completely fine which is why I didn���t want to ruin it with sugary fruits. I just wanted a deeper chocolate taste. With the nature���s bounty powder I included around 1-2 teaspoons of raw cacao powder and maybe 2 teaspoons or more (I eyeballed it����) of cinnamon. Blended it with almond milk, no sea moss gel this time and WOW! This was so good and something I can definitely look forward to drinking every morning. I got a deeper chocolate taste without extreme amounts of added sugar. Some may say fruit has good natural sugar but I just didn���t want it nor did I want to have ANY fruit taste I just wanted straight chocolate taste. It still has a ever so slight chalky texture but as I said before it���s tolerable compared to most. I felt like this compo kept me fuller a little longer. Now I know for sure I���ll be a returning customer of this product as long as the price and ingredients stay the same.

Original review: I mean...the taste is pretty good compared to what other protein powders taste like! Not going to lie, it has a very slight grainy/chalky texture but it���s not terrible at all. It could blend better. The taste is very similar to the chocolate Slimfast shake, which I love but I felt like the Slimfast didn���t offer enough or any at all dietary/nutritional benefits. I must say that the slimfast taste better though, but it could be cause it has added sugar. Though the nature���s bounty protein powder isn���t terrible tasting it���s a bit boring and I can tell it might not be a powder that I look forward to or get excited about every morning. The chocolate taste is just kinda faint and bland. I���m trying to lose weight and this brand and protein shake was the only one I found that was beneficial, decently tasty, VERY affordable, low in sugar, low in calories! I wish it was vegan but oh well. I had this shake with almond milk and some sea moss gel. I know it���s not a vegan option nor is it the most clean and organic but you can���t beat the price and the reviews seem pretty consistent on being good. I���m not sure if it���s considered or qualified to be a meal replacement but it���ll do. I���d like to mention I���m hypoglycemic and this shake was a great pick me up! It gave me a fast boost until I could make a full meal. It smells delicious. I���ll be buying again! Please keep the price low. I���m tired of seeing a beneficial protein powder come out to be $40 plus. Only for it to not taste that good.",10-Apr-21,Jazzy T,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHD6O6BJBJUYW2XR6XTMWJPAWY2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,11,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Love it,"I use this all the time. The taste is amazing. It doesn't have that protein aftertaste. I mix it with almond or oat milk so it doesn't foam. It gets a little thicker from the collegn in it if you let it sit. I add flax meal, cinnamon, cocoa at times. I drink it twice a day with a dinner and snacks. It makes things easy and I have had tons of protein and this is my favorite. I'm only giving it 4 stars because sometimes it gets really pricey then drops some again.

"I LOVE THIS STUFF ! ���� Have a subscription every 8 wks, never had an issue (until now.)","The chocolate flavor is REALLY good. Has so many vitamins, minerals, a digestive blend & even a little collagen. You'd never know this stuff was GOOD for you, LoL. I dont take it for weight management - So if you want to try this for the TASTE, added VIT/MIN, DIGESTIVE help and collagen - put 2 scopps of ice cream in and its sooooooo good. (I use coffee or vanilla, and put 8 Oz milk into my Blend jet 2 for 2 cycles - but do it how ya want. Just saying that its amazing this way.)

I CAN buy it at local store for same price but was nice to have it delivered exactly when I was running out. Until August order lol...... some reason it was supposed to arrive Monday Aug 7 & was delayed. It happens no biggie. Have had plenty of things delayed 1 - 3 days. But then the days went by & still never got it. (And I was out of my own supply by Wed.) Thurs...Fri...Sat....Sun....Mon...Tues...it's now the 15th so cancelled order.

Its an ""Amazon.com"" delivery & not blaming them per say, think might be the post office losing package. Because it says it was picked up. Then I got delayed message on Monday Aug 7. Waited all week and no other movement. Which is really wierd. Waited through the weekend and until Tues the next week (Today.) Just said screw it.

"Excellent, but typical in some ways.","I'm not a breakfast person but I'm trying to lose weight and need a morning kickstart and nutrients for my day. This is definitely low cal enough. It for sure has all the vitamins needed and more. The typical is mainly the flavor and sweetness. I'm looking for something that doesn't feel substantial in the morning and even in water (rather than suggested milk) feels heavy... it's typical of shakes... it's fine. Also it is very sweet rather than subtly sweet. I'd love a company to flavor their shakes based on flavor rather than sugar (sweetener) count! I always feel like they are trying to cover up a not great flavor by making it so sweet. But again, that's typical and every company out there seems to do one or the other - super nutrients (and taste meh) or good flavor (and not quite perfect in the nutrients) rather than both.

"Tastes good in milk, not water.","This stuff is great, I purchased it to drink instead of eating breakfast, It is recommended that you get 30 grams of protein in the morning if you are looking to lose weight. After having 4 kids and 6 additional pregnancies that I sadly miscarried, it has gotten a bit harder to lose weight than it used to be. I wanted a protein shake that tasted decent and had enough protein to make a difference, wasn't loaded with calories, and didn't contain too many chemicals or fake sugars.

Can't yet say it has helped me lose weight, I have 20 lbs to lose and so far after having been on it for 3 days, have gotten down 2 lbs, But can't exactly say the shake caused the loss though since it has only been 3 days and I have also been eating salad for lunch and a low calorie dinner. Before this I lost 5 lbs just eating salad for breakfast and lunch and a low calorie dinner. That was in 5 days.

As for the taste, In 8 ounces of milk (which brings the grams of protein up to 23), It is DELICIOUS! I mean really really good, you can't taste the stevia, It tastes like a milk shake. Really, really good!
In water, it is disgusting! You can totally taste the stevia, it leaves a nasty aftertaste, and just is hard going down.
If you add the cup of whole milk to it, you are still only getting 270 calories for breakfast which is a lot better than most breakfasts. When I can get to the store again, I am going to purchase some skim and see how it tastes with skim. I'll update when i've tried it that way.

I love the amount of vitamins, amino acids , probiotics, and even biotin that are in here. I feel good about drinking this not only to aid in my weight loss, but just for overall health.

If you are pregnant, and looking for a nutritional shake, this would not be for you, it contains Bromelain (from pineapple), which can cause contractions, It also contains Papain from Papaya, which is not known to be safe during pregnancy.
The only reason this go t 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is gross in water.
Will update in a week or so with any weight loss info.

Update: This is just as good in skim milk as it is in whole milk and I will be buying this brand again.",06-Mar-16,Mommy to 6 little peanuts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDV63XF7ACZUSEDFGTJCEKCGQ4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,10,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}
So far so good -- a first review.,"The price of Orgain, my favorite health drink, went through the roof. I looked around for a moderately priced replacement and found Nature' Bounty Vanilla. I examined the ingredients carefully and it all looked good.(Proprietary Protein Blend: Pea Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Rice Protein Concentrate, Fructose, Inulin, Natural Flavors, Maltodextrin, Tricalcium Phosphate, Xanthan Gum, Soy Lecithin, Contains milk and soy ingredients.) Additionally, only 6 grams of sugar per serving-- some of the health drinks have as much as 22 grams of sugar, too much, in my opinion.

This drink tastes like what it is -- a health food; that is, it won't be confused with a soda fountain vanilla milkshake. Even so, I found it pleasant when mixed with eight ounces of one per cent milk. I put the two tablespoons of the protein powder in milk and then used a soda fountain style mixer to blend the ingredients. After a couple of minutes I poured the mix into a glass. The powder was completely disolved and the drink did look like a soda fountain shake, but as mentioned, tasted like a light vanilla health food beverage. When I added two tablespoons of Carnation Malted Milk to the mix, the flavor improved dramatically. Even so, it still tastes like what it is -- health food.

I will let the nutrition experts comment on the true value of this product for our health and well being. I'll come back to this review after I have finished the entire contents of the 16 ounce container and update Amazon readers about any perceived health benefits from this product.

Update: I continue to use this protein shake and find it filling and satisfying. I now add coffee milk to the mix and the flavor has improved dramatically.

Update 2: I tried the chocolate flavor and like it better than the vanila. It has a cocoa taste and is not too sweet. I then added a tablespoon of Carnation Malted Milk to the second shake I made and liked the results very much. It seems like this is a nutritious drink, but I am open to comments from people who know more than I do.

Great shake,I ordered this shake to help kick start my new healthy lifestyle. I use a blender and blend with my coffee or make a chocolate banana shake. The texture is fine and not too gritty. For the price point it feel it is a great value.,07-Oct-23,April,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGY2M6KTC3YQZW3QHJ7IJQNBJPDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,1,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Price is ridiculous right now,"I've only used the chocolate but it's definitely delicious and blends up completely smooth in my blender bottle. If I drink it right away it might be a little gritty, not gross though, but I usually put it back in the fridge for an hour and by then it's all disolved and smooth.

The problem is the price here. I've bought it for $9 to $11 here on Amazon and that's a fair price but $15 to $23, which I've seen it recently, is way too much. It only has 15grams of protein in it per 2 scoops, which is pretty low. Most other protein powders have 25 to 30g of protein per serving. Also the container is super tiny. I think it only has 11 or 12 servings in it if you're careful. I love it but I'm not paying more than $11 for it.

I've ordered something else for now that was on sale. Something that has the normal 30grams of protein so I could even divide that in half making it last twice as long and get the same as in this.",21-Dec-22,R.K.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBX2P5K4O5XSJ5JQZS37H4NYXSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,34,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'Decadent chocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
I have heard this is a good dupe for Shakeology,"I purchased this since I am now going to the gym and need protein boost to help aid in toning. Also, I am hoping to drop a few pounds so I plan to use as a meal replacement (likely breakfast) and I may also use as a post workout shake for some gym days as needed. I have only used this for a few days now so I cannot yet comment on it's assistance in my weight loss. However, I can provide information on toleration and taste.

I purchased on Amazon for about $15 which is a decent price for the ingredients. I have heard this is a good dupe for Shakeology. It really has an impressive vitamin content in the mix which is great because I am also working to grow my hair out so Im really hoping this will be an great addition to my current vitamin regimen which now consists of a basic multi-vitamin and an iron pill that is advised by my doctor.

How I mix: So far I have been mixing 2 scoops of the Chocolate protein mix with water to keep down calories but will soon try with Almond milk. I use 2 scoops of protein, a half banana, a tbsp of PB2 and tsp of virgin coconut oil, a few cubes and sometimes a tsp of cocoa powder and voila! It's a decent tasting shake. It can be a bit chalky but I'm sure that will be better once I try it with almond milk.So far it actually seems to be aiding my digestion and I haven't experience any negative affects to it which is a surprise because I experienced some issues with GNC proteins I've used in the past.

I think this is a pretty good protein shake for the price.

UPDATE: I have used this powder about 4 to 5 days per week as a breakfast replacement for 3 weeks now and I'm really shocked but I believe this is really helping me. I haven't weighed but I have been getting compliments on looking slimmer. I myself have noticed I'm looking quite a bit more toned especially in the belly area, I'm not sure if this is due to the probiotics in the products controlling bloat. I haven't changed anything else in my diet as a whole whatsoever but I am working out which I was also doing prior to purchasing this product. I do notice that I am not feeling as hungry at times throughout the day. Not much difference but I think overall I am eating a bit less.

On the negative side I am noticing a bit of breakout on my skin that started right around the time I began taking this powder but I can't verify this is related. I will continue to use this product and will likely be ordering this again soon!",18-Apr-16,Jem,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVBZN3NYPEWY55BM56B5PJK2UGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,271,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Great Before the Price Change,"First of all, this is a good product. I usually have a shake with 2 scoops of chocolate and 8-10 ounces of Almond/Cashew Milk Blend. I normally drink this shake in sips during my workout, from about 6:30 am until 7:30 am. I then eat breakfast around 8, consuming a little bit of fruit and water. This sets me up to be ready to eat around 11:30, which is decent, considering that I will usually have taken in 0 net calories for the day by lunch. I have only tried the Chocolate flavor, and I must say, I was amazed by how good it tasted: this is my first time trying protein shakes and I was pleasantly surprised. I have tried it with water, skim milk, vanilla soy milk, almond milk, and unsweetened Almond/Cashew Milk (it's been a wild ride). Water will do, but it must be very cold or else the shake isn't very enjoyable at all. Skim milk definitely tastes the best, but I have a sensitivity to lactose, and the delicious taste of the shake is not worth the discomfort later. Vanilla soy milk has been quite sweet, but I've never been a fan of soy milk, and that carries over into it in shakes. However, I would assume that people who like soy milk plain would enjoy it in shakes more than I do. Almond milk tastes good, the kind I used was very lightly sweetened and it was fairly enjoyable to drink. The mix of unsweetened Almond and Cashew Milk (Blue Diamond Brand) has been my favorite so far: it's quite creamy, thanks to the cashews; the milk only has 25 calories per serving, which is second only to water; and it sits with me much better than the skim milk.

Now, here comes the bad part: I have been using this for about 2 weeks, and when I first bought it, I paid less than $9 (with the $1 coupon and the lower price). Now, the price has gone up and I'm not sure that I'll continue using it.",02-Feb-16,Whitney H.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGV5NV4RDKWR2CPT7RVEXZUO5DFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,2,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Good shake base,"I have a really hard time functioning when I wake up early. Often times I don't eat breakfast, then by the time I get home from work (which is 8 hours of direct patient care where I might also not eat) I feel like I've been hit by a bus and I end up being useless for the rest of the day. I got this so I would have something easy to have in the morning. I don't use it as directed, instead I blend it in with some frozen fruit, milk, and water and it tastes pretty good. I have found that when I come home from work I am feeling much better than I did before.

It does thicken nicely (if that's what you want, if not add more water). My only complaint about it is by itself it does have a bit of an odd aftertaste, almost like fake sugar after taste but not quite. However, I don't taste it when I'm mixing it in with a bit of fruit.

I got it on sale for $7, which is a great deal. If I paid full price I'm not sure that I would feel the same way. There are 13 servings so on sale it's 50 cents a serving.

Great price and decent flavor if you love vanilla!,"Got vanilla because some said it was way better than the chocolate. Not crazy about vanilla flavor in general, but this wasn���t too terrible. Yes it has that sweet sweet vanilla flavor with unsweetened almond milk. I only had it once so I can���t say for sure yet how well the vitamins in it work for my body. I���ll also try the chocolate to compare taste. I will say you can���t beat the cost. I was buying another soy protein that was $27 for 10 servings so this makes your money go a long way which is great. I���ll try to add berries to the vanilla as some folks have done to help it to be more enjoyable.

Also peeps were saying they received a half full canister. These things settle once filled. Most things like this aren���t ever filled to the top. That doesn���t mean you were cheated. Only if thE product was opened of course. Then I would absolutely question if some was missing. My product came quickly and was sealed. When I opened it there was about 1/3 space between the powder and the top. No biggie. Like I said you can���t beat the price compared to other protein powders out there.",02-Jul-20,LindsayMG28,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZOBD4BLU77BYULQV7DKO4KWZRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,0,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}
Pretty good protein shake!,"This is the first time I've tried a product like this, so I'm afraid I can't compare it to others. However, I was expecting something pretty awful, something I'd have to force down. Surprisingly, this stuff actually tastes pretty good. I mix up a serving of this after my workout to help speed up my recovery. It seems to work, and I'm not feeling sore for as long after a hard workout.

But how's it taste? Depends on what you mix it in. If I need the extra calories, I'll mix it in a glass of almond milk. It tastes best that way, like chocolate milk! I can drink it in water as well; but I tend to use about 6 ounces of water instead of 8. It tastes too watered down with 8 ounces.

I'll admit, I'm too lazy to bring out my blender for a tiny protein shake, so I just blend it by hand. A whisk works fairly well. The easiest way is to put your water/milk into a water bottle, add the powder and shake the bottle. Shaking it really breaks up the clumps!

In the end, it's still a bit powdery, but it doesn't bother me. I always follow it with a drink of something else, because it tends to leave an odd taste behind.

As a warning: If you aren't used to taking something like this, you might want to start out slowly. This stuff can tear your stomach up. Perhaps start with half a serving daily and work your way up.

Well I started getting light headed and dizzy because of this but i couldnt even choke down a banana before noon so I started trying this. My only real problem with this is that it says to mix with cool water or milk.. DO NOT try with water, it was the worst thing I ever tasted. It wasn't bad with milk, but this product doesnt disolve well in cold drinks (i have not had the chance to try in a drink I used 2% milk) Ive started putting this in with my hot coffee, it mixes much better with warm drinks then cold and just one cup of coffee with one scoop of this keeps me going intil lunch time without me feeling dizzy or sick!

"Good, Buying Again","I bought this product because it was hard for me to remember to take vitamins every day and I thought this may help. The powder is like the consistency of hot cocoa powder. The taste is good if blended well. The things I blended this with was I made either a smoothie with it using chocolate almond milk and that would be it or I would throw 1 banana in the smoothie as well to give it some body. Sometimes I would just make a cup of coffee in the morning and mix it in there, it was surprisingly very good!!

I would use a blended to blend this or maybe a fork or whisk. It doesn't blend very well using just a spoon, it clumps up and you can taste the clumps. Also, I only used ONE scoop a day. Just one. It's enough for taste and it lasted me more than 30 days. I bought this product on 2/23/2020 and it's 3/31/2020 and I'd say I have about 2 or 3 scoops left.

1: Gives a little energy boost, tasted weird at first. Need to have a small snack with it to really feel full until lunchtime.

"this has a great taste, but mixing is another story","I love the taste of this mix and have high hopes for it, I bought it because I am a cancer patient and have a hard time eating nearly anything lately. saw this mix, read the label and decided to pull the trigger on it. my only real issue with it is, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get it to dissolve unless you use a mixer or blender. the first time I mad it, I literally sat there stirring it for about a solid 5 minutes and there were still undissolved decent sized clumps floating in it. I've gone to using a mixer for it with more success but still get a little bit of small clumps floating. today I tried mixing it in my coffee just to see if that would help, and it's actually nearly 100% dissolved. maybe this requires a warm liquid to mix it properly even though the label says it can be mixed with water or milk, so I assumed it meant cool/cold liquids. over all it does seem to be a great product though",23-Apr-20,njvkjuck,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXTRQGCEXVFXDPCMNYNRS576YYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,0,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Great taste but no scoop!,My shake is nice and thick and chocolaty but not sure if that is because of the product or because I have too much protein powder.

Protein for the Non-Athlete,"This is delicious. The chocolate flavor is light yet rich. The texture when mixed with a liquid is similar to that of a smoothie or chocolate milk-not too think and not too watery. I put a little less than the serving suggestion of liquid to retain some thickness. Rather than water I prefer unsweetened coconut milk. The protein powder is sweet as is and does not need any added sweetness. Sometimes I add a couple strawberries or a little yogurt just for fun, because it tastes wonderful on its own. My experience regarding appetite suppressant ability was a hit and miss. Sometimes it kept me full for up to 6 hours, and other times it appeared not to do much of anything for my appetite, and I would eat a small meal shortly after. In conclusion, to achieve more of a full sensation, add at least 8 oz of liquid or more. This shake can be hand mixed or blended. It will look chunkier if you mix it by hand, but the texture will be smooth when you drink it. I am very satisfied with this product because it gives me an option to reduce my calorie intake and avoid constant snacking in the evening.

Starbucks hacks below,"If you dont end up liking the flavor of the vanilla it is very difficult to mask with other stronger flavors. That being said I do like the flavor, it's blends very well because the powder changes the viscosity of liquids its added to. That being said, I work at starbucks and I have taken my blended beverage knowledge and played around with this powder a bit. If you add coffee and a flavor to this the powder will act like frappuccino base but without sugar. It is perfect if you do 1 cup ice, 1/2 cup milk (I use almond milk) and 1/2 cup cold brew coffee or 1 cup of milk and 1-2 shots of espresso, 1 tsp vanilla or almond extract or 2-3 pumps of flavor (you can buy the bottles of syrup from Starbucks, including the sugar free ones, if you like them and they are about $12 and last for a month once opened) and 2 scoops of the powder and blend. Or if your not worried about calories, you can buy a tall vanilla cream cold brew with no ice and blend it at home with 1 cup of ice and one serving of this protein powder and it fantastic.

I absolutely love everything else about Shakeology ��� the taste and the ...,"I have been searching for something to replace Shakeology, due to the cost. I absolutely love everything else about Shakeology ��� the taste and the health benefits ��� but the cost, even when I was a coach, is extreme. I gave Idealshake (chocolate) a try (too frothy, sugary and sweet) and I gave Vega (chocolate and vanilla) a try. Vega was better than Idealshake but neither came close to ShakeO. I read the reviews of how Nature���s Bounty is the closest thing to Shakeology that people have found. I agree. Here are the two main differences I have noticed thus far ��� NB does not mix up anywhere near as thick as Shakeology. If the thickness of SO has been a turn-off to you, then you would definitely like this about NB. The other difference is the chocolate flavor in NB shakes is on the mild side. I love the taste of chocolate ShakeO so this kinda��� bums me out, however, not enough that I won���t make the switch.

It doesnt blend super great at times so I have to scrape the sides and reblend it to try and get it as mixed as possible.

Nice meal replacement/snack option when trying to lose weight,"I purchased this as a substitute for the Isalean shakes that I have been drinking as part of that program. I like them very much but the program is very expensive. I did some research and the Nature's Bounty came up as a suitable meal replacement substitute. I mix it with 6oz water and 2 oz 1% milk to boost the protein a bit to keep me fuller, longer. The taste is pretty good, the consistency of the shake is a bit thin in comparison to what I had been drinking but it's not a bad thing. It's not gritty like some protein drinks can be. I only ordered the chocolate flavor and it's tastes like chocolate milk to me. I like that it is low in calories, sugar, and that it has probiotics in it. It has helped me to keep my hunger at bay while I am trying to lose weight. I do use it usually as a lunch substitute. It's a very good value price wise compared to other products I have seen.

It's ok but it's great if tweaked a little,"This is one of the better protein powders I've found. Still, when mixed even with milk there's that unpleasant aftertaste that most protein powders have. I was able to remedy that. It does add a few calories but my main goal was to have a meal replacement smoothie, so I'm ok with a few added calories. What I did is mix two scoops of the powder with 8 oz of 1% milk and about a 1/4 cup of almond milk. Then I added a banana and a couple teaspoons of Mocafe Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate (also available on Amazon and it is DIVINE) that I mixed with a little bit of hot water first (necessary to make it mix in smoothly). You could add however much of this to taste as you wish - each teaspoon is roughly 16 calories - but it doesn't take much because it's quite sweet and the recommended serving on the package is WAY too much, even when I'm making Mexican mochas. Then there's however many calories the average banana is and the little bit of almond milk.

Good start to my work day,I recently purchased me a ninja smoothie maker and I wanted to start drinking smoothies for breakfast. not so much for weight loss butt for the vitamins and nutrients value. I was pretty confused as to which one I wanted to try I know I wanted one that was low in sugar high in fiber and this seemed to be the best 1. Now I must say I never drink it alone I always mix it with lots of fruit and water or almond milk and then in my smoothie. The Taste is pretty smooth not at all chalky and at 15 grams of protein per 2 scoops it fit the bill. I know there are other protein powders out there that offer a much larger container for not much more money but I don't like to purchase one that large in case I don't like it so I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get their nutrition in and like smoothies it's kept me full all morning and then to lunch great start to my day,26-Sep-16,L MARTINEZ,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3HAAWNN232CGI6UPPR7BAVHXAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,2,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}
Good - but chocolate is better,"First off - the chocolate flavor of this is 10x better but I tried the vanilla first in case I wanted to mix in some fruit. It tastes good with anything but water.

My go to is a shaker cup full of ice, 1 cup almond milk, 1 scoop of each chocolate/vanilla powder, fill the rest up with cold brewed coffee. It���s my every morning drink.

"Fine product, but 18% sugar unneeded","This is a very good powdered multi vitamin with other nutrients. I like it; I'm ordering it a second time. But it's 18% sugar (6 grams sugar per 33 grams serving). That's unneeded. I think a lot of people like me would prefer no sugar added. There was a powdered multivitamin called RDA that is no longer made. It had no sugar added. It was made by a small company, Lewis Labs, whose marketing was not good, and which discontinued the item. I believe Nature's Bounty is trying to compete on this item with GNC, which has very sweet powdered vitamins with caffeine--which this product does not have. Maybe, in addition to the Vanilla and chocolate flavors, Nature's Bounty could offer a no-sugar-added version of the same product, and test whether it sells over perhaps 6-9 months.

I used the BlenderBottle shaker to mix just the powder and the milk, and it was great! What a difference the almond milk makes.

I am a taller girl and have a bit more of a speedy metabolism, so maybe that���s why. But I tried this a couple times with banana and some milk in a smoothie and still wanted to eat about an hour or less afterward.

Not a good protein drink for supplementing meals or hunger.

Of course, it still has that ""protein powder"" taste, but it is enjoyable. I have been trying others to see what else is out there and getting some with higher protein levels.

Natures bounty also has a lot fewer calories than the other ones I've tried which is nice if you aren't using it to replace food necessarily.

The good news: an hour later, after I had sworn never to drink this again, I was feeling FABULOUS. I'm not talking just OK, I mean, GREAT. Energized, satisfied, full, not at all hyper like on a caffeine laden product, just good, like after a great workout.
So I've decided that I can suck it up and swallow this down to feel this good. It cost $20 for 13 servings, which is OK. Right there with the other protein powders. I think the nutrition in this is better. It has flaxseed, collagen, all the amino acids, fiber, all your basic vitamins and most at 100%, and all without artificial sweeteners and only 110 calories and 5 net carbs.
Hope this helps someone else trying to decide.",15-Dec-16,Dodie's Doodles,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFOI6OXLDZJ3FYP5RWFQNWJTEPWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,17,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

"Great taste, but a little pricey.","This stuff is pretty good. I used ""All the Whey"" brand back in the day and this stuff tastes just as good, but a little thicker. Almost like a really thick milkshake. I mix 16oz of unsweetened coconut milk with this and drink it for breakfast on my way to work. It tastes almost like semi-sweet dark chocolate, which I love. I also tried mixing in a little Splenda one morning to sweeten it up a bit and it tasted more like a Hershey bar. Either way is fine by me. Some people might have a problem with the consistency. It is a protein shake after all and that is a common complaint. But it's the best tasting protein shake that I've had in a long time.

"Seriously, tastes great, no lie!","I don't know what the ""not like"" fuss is about. It's delicious! I just made my first smoothie - very simple. 1/2 cup almond milk, 1 1/2 teaspoons almond butter, 2 scoops powder, 1/2 frozen banana, 1/3 cup frozen black berries. I have a simple Oster blender. I am enjoying this very much! And, i adapted the recipe from a book called Zero Belly Smooties. They said to use 1/2 cup of protein powder, but I used two scoops as recommended by the manufacturer. Note: this is my very FIRST protein shake. I don't even taste the powder, and no bad after taste in my opinion. I am 52, pretty slender - just want to lose 5 or 10 lbs and eat healthier.

Vanilla flavor is great!,"I ordered this after doing a lot of research. I ordered the chocolate but got vanilla instead but decided to just keep it and not return it. I think the vanilla flavor is really great! I drink it every day for breakfast. I use half a frozen banana, 4 oz of water, 4 oz of non-dairy milk (I use oat or almond), three ice cubes, and two scoops of the powder.

This is such an easy product to drink; no chalky taste, no aftertaste and I actually look forward to drinking it in the mornings! I've also chugging drinking my morning coffee while at work.

Tastes great for a vitamin-packed protein shake!,"No complaints on the taste--even my kids approved a small taste of it (they wanted more than a small taste!). Barely any chalky aftertaste, too. As for any health benefits, I've yet to see anything amazing, but I didn't buy it for that purpose anyhow. I bought for a quick, healthy breakfast, since I barely have time to sit down and eat a ""real"" breakfast in the morning. With these shakes, I can make one, and drink as I'm on the go. I bought a ""Blender Bottle"" to make these, and it's nothing short of amazing!

The only con for me about the shake mix is that it's made with soy, which I try to avoid. For that reason, I won't buy this again.

Best chocolate tasting protein mix!,"I've tried many chocolate flavored protein mixes over the last 6 months, and this one is my favorite chocolate flavored one.

I use 3-4 ice cubes, 2 scoops of this mix (the scoop is small), add about 10-12 oz. of unsweetened almond milk. It's really very chocolatety tasting and I love it! It does give me a little burst of energy about a half hour later that lasts a few hours. Satisfied feeling for a couple of hours before feeling hungry.

Good!,"This protein shake is actually very good. I ordered the chocolate and usually mix it with a little peanut butter and some almond milk. Every now and then I'll throw in a banana, or coconut (think mounds shake!). At first try this shake is very powder-y. However, if you mix it in a blender for about 30 secs and add more than just water to it, it is very good. What drew me to it was all the vitamins and probiotics. It does not taste like swallowing a vitamin. And the chocolate is pretty rich. If you prefer to drink shakes for b-fast then give this one a try. I'm not a body builder or gym rat. I am just a mom who prefers something quick in the morning and full of nutrients. I am very health conscience and maintain a healthy diet and exercise 5 days a week.

Good and great price,I bought this in order to help regulate my digestive system and to help make sure I'm getting all the extra I don't get when I slack on eating right. I'm also nursing so I wanted something I knew was safe for that and would help my daughter too. I really like this product and the price is unbeatable! Although I'm not overly thrilled with the chocolate taste.. But I definitely think it tastes better than Shakoligy! It lasted me a little over two weeks rather than the 30 days it states.

Pretty good,"I've used the chocolate and the vanilla, and I'm not an athlete or a body builder, I'm just a regular person who likes food to taste good. So here's what I think: as far as protein powder goes, these are both pretty great. Price, flavor and texture are most important to me and these are good. I've blended these a couple of different ways, including following the directions that say to blend with water. Blended with water they are kind of ""meh"" as a lot of protein drinks kind of are, but blended with milk and fruit is very tasty and texturally pleasing. That's how I do it most of the time.

Needs something more to be truly filling,"Needs something more to be truly filling--definitely not a meal replacement on its own. I know it's not designed to be, obviously, but I did an experiment to see how well it would fill me up mixed with just water and drank on an empty stomach, and it didn't feel like much more than a granola bar would've done. Texture is smooth (added to water in a mason jar and shook to mix), taste is a pleasant vanilla, very sweet with a slight stevia/protein powder aftertaste, but not overwhelming. No troubles with digestive upset from having it on an empty stomach.

I like the list of vitamins and probiotics, which is why I decided to try it to help resolve some bloating issues, but it seems I'll have to use it mainly as a supplement or additive.",08-Mar-16,Cestep,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTHFHFOINCQ2AOYTXGBD5JCRRMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,0,4 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}

I like to smooth flavor,"I like to smooth flavor, not too sweet, good meal replacement as you don't get hungry right away. Mixes well with fruits. Downside is when you add a fat like coconut oil or peanut butter the ice clumps up. I used to drink Shakeology and the flavor is more vanilla than ShakeO and good. Definitely ShakeO you get more vitamins but with this product you also get vitamins and then I take a pre-natal so its fine. Lastly, I just wish it was thicker, ShakeO is very thick and this isn't at all unless you use coconut milk or regular almond milk but over all, it compares very well when it comes to low sugars and good healthy carbs and vitamins.

Good unless they send wrong flavor again,I have been drinking this as my breakfast for over a year. The chocolate tastes great and isn���t too sweet like other protein shakes I���ve had.

This is my truth..,"I bought this product to make sure I���m getting my daily vitamins, and as a morning meal replacement shake. What I like about this shake is it does keep me full longer then other shakes I���ve tried, it���s versatile so I can mix my shake with vegetables or fruits. I will say it can taste chalky (at least to me) when it���s just the shake mix with almond milk, that���s another reason I mix fruits with it in the morning.

Formulated to meet the needs of today's health-conscious woman.,"Very tasty, I enjoy one at least daily and haven't gotten sick of them. Cheaper than the HMR shakes, but don't seem to be as good at appetite suppressing (I don't see anything in the description saying they would, so it's not a mark against them).

Wider variety of flavors would be nice, but vanilla/chocolate is pretty standard.

Little puzzled with the description of, ""Nature's Bounty Optimal Solutions Complete Protein and Vitamin Shake Mix is formulated to meet the needs of today's health-conscious woman."" <- I don't see anything on the bottle about it being for women... 2mg of iron isn't that bad, especially since I don't eat much read meat these days.

I have vanilla I mix it with almond milk and fruit honey in a blender and it comes out tasting like heaven. The texture isn't gritty to me and after using it for about three weeks i notice a glow, my belly area a little tighten ( thanks to the collagen in it), and a sense of good health due to the vitamins and probiotics.

"Great nutrition, so-so flavor from a non-vanilla lover","Nutrition wise, it's great. Just look at that tag! Flavor, I have to disagree. Granted, vanilla is NOT a flavor I turn to.

If that's what you want, cool.

I'm currently using extra flavoring for my taste's sake (or using it with almond milk + cereal), but I'll definitely get a different flavor next time.

Have Crohn's disease - tastes decent and doesn't upset my stomach,"I bought this because I've been dragging lately and thought an extra boost wouldn't hurt.

"Great product, but...","I was so excited about this product. I had done a lot of research and value for the price couldn't be touched, IMO. The taste is plenty good, as protein shakes go. It's loaded with vitamins and other supplements, so I was able to discontinue several other supplements plus have a great dose of protein and use it as a meal replacement but I had just eliminated dairy from my diet and hadn't considered the whey in it. So I couldn't continue using it. More than that, I found that it greatly bloated me and was constipatng. I'm actually very disappointed because it was the best product I found for the price to replace a lot of supplements and provide and affordable meal replacement and protein, so now I'm back to the drawing board. There's a possibility that I could have worked with it more and made it work, but sadly I just don't feel great when I take it. I've been on one type of protein shake or the other for 20-30 years, so I was really excited about the content of this one for the price. I highly recommend it for that and the flavor. If you're considering it, I think you should give it a great try. I think this might have been a great find in my 20s or 30s, but it's not working for me at this age. I would love to give it 5 stars because it met my expectations for price, supplements included, flavor, protein, and ability to serve as a meal replacement, but I just can't continue taking it. I would recommend it and am going to continue to recommend it to people I talk with, because it seems like a great product, but I just don't feel well when I take it. I think it's worth giving it a shot. Your results may be different.

Just OK,"My main goal in using a meal replacement/nutritional supplement shake was to keep myself from getting to the point where I'm starving and end up binging on the nearest convenience food. I don't usually eat breakfast so I thought this could be a morning ""meal"" in the hopes that I would not be so hungry by lunchtime I hit the first drivethru I can find and order 6 of everything, or eat lunch at 10:30 and be dying by 2 pm. So far, it hasn't really worked, but I'm probably getting some vitamins and minerals that are lacking in my diet so I guess it's a wash. I don't know a whole lot about this kind of stuff, to be perfectly honest, so I'm not going to comment on it nutritionally. I looked at shakeology because a couple acquaintances are pushers but the cost of the stuff is unacceptable. In doing a little googling, there were a couple blogs that recommended this (among others) as a similar, yet cheaper, product. I decided to try the vanilla since I could play with the flavor more than with the chocolate.

Tastewise, it's ok. Vanilla flavor is mild but there. There is a significantly pronounced flavor of artificial sweeteners which I hate. I'd much prefer a less sweet product that I could sweeten to taste with something I actually like (raw honey, agave nectar, maple syrup, ANYTHING but artificial junk) or just not be as sweet.

Texturewise, it's ok. Little chalky but it could be a lot worse. The instructions are to mix 2 scoops with 8 oz of water. I found that to be too thick for my taste. For me, the sweet spot is right around 12-14 oz- that is about the consistency of chocolate milk. The powder does tend to cling to the edges and sides of the blender bottle so i find I need to stir/scrape with a table knife to loosen it before I shake it.

Generally speaking, it's just ok. There are a couple other products I'd like to try, but this one isn't bad. I will finish this tub before I order something else.

So far my preferred method has been to stir 2 scoops of powder into 10 oz of hot chai tea (black) and add enough ice to get up around the 14 oz mark and shake until the ice melts and the shake is cold. This gives me a mild iced chai latte kind of beverage that is actually pretty enjoyable.",05-Nov-15,MessieJessie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH2YITTU6MK6YHY56KWFMMCCQYFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,1,3 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}

Great tasting but read and research ingredients,"I bought this because I don't eat right. I don't eat bad, but I don't eat enough to get a full profile of protein, vitamins, minerals, etc. I start using this and blending it with lactose free milk, which I am fine with. I developed tinnitus, seemingly out of the blue. Kind of strange I thought. Then it started happening that my throat would swell up every now and then when I would eat something. The tinnitus would start almost an hour after having this shake. I started researching the label ingredients and the amino acid profile has histidine, which converts to histamine, and can cause histamine intolerance if you have too much histamine in your body. Also the aspartic acid and glutamic acid can also cause other issues. I have since stopped taking it and my tinnitus is waning, not as bad as it was. I'm still dealing with the histamine issues. I've gone on an elimination diet where I'm just consuming low histamine whole foods now and hopefully once all the extra histamine is degraded my symptoms will clear up.

I subscribed to monthly delivery at $12.87 per unit and got my first delivery. For my second monthly delivery, they increased my price to 19.79, a 54% jump. So I cancelled. I don't know if it's Nature's Bounty of Amazon behind this bait & switch pricing, but it's a highly corrupt attempt at ripping off their customers.",26-Jul-21,Steph,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHANHZIIYR3UN46OQFE2NIZJ5ARQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,163,3 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
"Good protein shake, but read the label closely if you have sensitivities.","I purchased this after trying a sample I'd received from the company. It has a very nice flavor and texture (I used it with almond milk) and It provided me with sufficient energy and hunger satiation until lunchtime.
My only real issue is that I had to start experiencing side effects to realize that the shake mix contains ingredients that I have sensitivities to but are not announced prominently on the label.
The label states that it is ""suitable for vegetarians"" but apparently that makes the assumption that vegetarians consume dairy/dairy products - which not all do and I absolutely do not. The only place it states that it contains dairy products is in fine print at the very bottom of the ingredients list. No mention of whey on the front label and even though it doesn't appear until about midway through the ingredients list, it was enough to disrupt my day after I'd been using it for about a week.

So overall, not at all a bad product -- definitely the tastiest shake I've encountered and it has a nice, smooth texture -- but if you're avoiding dairy based whey or need a true vegetarian/vegan option, I'd pass on this one.

I won't be purchasing this brand again in the future unless they release a new whey free formula. I'd personally recommend numedica (which is my usual - it is vegan, but rather pricey) or hemp protein (very effective, but some have slightly 'off' tastes, depending on the brand) if you're in the same boat as I am nutritionally.",18-Apr-13,Christina C.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEX6YHU6PNFKPEQ6H5ESYDKIB3ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,5,3 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'VanillaSize: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1)'}

Great price and nutrition...but tastes bad and clumps!,"I bought this because it has sooo many things in it! Vitamins, protein, AND probiotics! Most powders I've seen don't come with probiotics, so I was very impressed! Plus, it's really cheap! (You'd have to buy two to last most of the month. Two jars will get you about 26 servings, but that still ends up being cheaper than a lot of the competitors.) The taste....I hate the taste, but I didn't think I'd like it because I hate the taste of stevia, which is what this is sweetened with. I found a way around the taste, though. I just added two tablespoons of erythritol to it, and now it tastes wonderful because it masks the nasty stevia taste! BUUUUT, there's the clumping issue! It clumps up so badly and I don't know how to fix it. But that comes with the territory. I just put it through a mini strainer and it helped.

Okay...,"This was my first time purchasing a protein powder to add as my post-workout shake. I had to shake my bottle for about 2 minutes before it became a creamy enough consistency.

But mixing with almond or soy milk which already has some sugar in them took the sweetness too high and became disgustingly sweet.

It mixes well in my blender bottle and isn't clumpy, which is nice.
I've used Advocare Meal Shakes in the past, and those are much better. Will probably spend the extra money to get those instead next time.

I found a way to use it but won't buy it again,"Eh... I didn't like it at all when mixed with milk or with cashew milk. Sure, it's got nutrients . . . but it didn't dissolve well so there were chunks of powder than I was not a fan of, no matter how much I stirred and mixed, and was only slightly better when made with water (and then it was thin with slight chunks). But, I found an occasional use - I make a smoothie that's half coffee, a little bit of milk, a frozen banana, and a couple of ice cubes, and 2 scoops of this protein powder.

The package claims it contains a pound of powder (a two week supply) and while I didn't weigh it to confirm that amount, it certainly did not seem to be enough to last me two weeks. In fact, the container was only half filled with powder. While that might have been the advertised amount of powder, a half-filled container is a waste of packaging product and space.

Why does this never dissolve???,"From the largely positive reviews, it FEELS like I'm doing this wrong. I've stirred, shaken, and blended with warm and cold water and milk and cold almond milk. I even tried one with warm milk stirred, shaken AND blended and IT STILL WON'T DISSOLVE to any sort of satisfactory level. And it's not a couple little pebbles; you can't just ""smush"" it because it just regroups. There's no point in even reading the nutrition facts because you're only getting like a tenth of it anyway, unless you ""drink"" mouthfuls of them. I'm so irritated with this facet of the product that any of the other benefits advertised still wouldn't get me to purchase it again.

It tastes STRONGLY of what I'm assuming is an artificial sweetener. Enough that I have to actively think about the fact that it's chocolate flavored to remember that's the taste I'm looking for. If you drink diet coke or the likes, this probably wouldn't be that much of a negative, but I hate it. I tried various methods to cover the taste and most things work if you put enough of it in. I have a mint cocoa that covers it well if you mix equal parts, peanut butter is pretty effective. Other chocolate decidedly doesn't do it, though. You can get it pretty tolerable, but I still haven't actually ""finished"" one because when you get to the bottom, it's just a layer or two of the pebbles described above; it's foul.

The benefits it boasts do sound like what I'm looking for. It's disappointing that it wasn't usable in practice.",04-Jan-23,Samantha Angell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF25K5RZVZRU35AXB3ZSMJJUGJNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,0,2 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'Decadent chocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

"Vanilla: great ingredients, good consistency, horrible taste.","I really like the ingredient list. I like that it's all natural, and so much of it is organic. I love how packed it is with vitamins and supplements, though I do wish I knew what they were derived from.

I also like the consistency. Like most soy/whey drinks, this is a lot smoother than the vegan mixes. I did find that the recommended proportions were watery, and I had to either reduce water or increase the mix - but I know a lot of people mix up their shakes with other liquids or with additional ingredients, so that might not be an issue for everyone.

I can't stand the taste. I got the vanilla. The chocolate may be better, but I'm not willing to spend the money to find out.

First of all, it's sweetened entirely with stevia (unless you count the inulin, which I don't think contributes significantly). I don't mind some stevia, but this much leaves the distinctive non-sugar sweetness lingering in my mouth for an hour or more, which is not welcome. Secondly, regardless of the sweetener it's much too sweet. I know that's common with shakes, but some of them manage to avoid it and I wish this one had tried.

Thirdly, I don't understand how something with all-natural ingredients can taste so fake. I really like real vanilla, and I know this contains real vanilla, but it smells and tastes like the cheapest not-even-trying artificial flavoring imaginable.

I was looking for something soy and/or whey-based to mix with the 'lightly sweet' Garden of Life vegan mix because that's just a little too gritty for me by itself. I was using Lineavi, but I don't like that it contains artificial flavor (and yet tastes better than this does - go figure). I don't like wasting money, so I am grimly using this mix up doing that, and as long as I keep the ration to 50% or under, it's okay. Not great, but okay. When it's gone and I can justify buying a replacement, I'll be grateful.",23-Dec-17,Ambagious,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBC2Q7XKLOZDKV7GNNY7UFOQO6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,4,2 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

Not for me- Upset my stomach :(,"I made a shake for breakfast today- used two scoops as directed, half a cup of ice and a cup of almond milk. I drank the shake between 8:00 am and 8:30 a.m. It is now 9:40 a.m and I have gone to the bathroom three times. I'm not sure why it made my stomach so upset, but I'm very disappointed since this product got such great reviews. As far as the taste, it tastes weird. It tastes like a drink that has stevia in it, but I don't know the taste is overpowering. Obviously though, this product is all natural, so it's not supposed to taste super amazing. I'm used to drinking teas and adding stevia to it as a sweetener. I eat a lot of gluten free products and products that contain stevia as a sweetener, so I'm used to the taste. I don't use regular sugar or artificial sweeteners, so I am accustomed to the taste stevia has, but the taste is overpowering and then it's mixed with the taste of chocolate. Maybe if I had added a banana? Not sure. I'll probably try it again on the weekend just to see what happens. I also have a sensitivity to fodmaps, (sugars found in fruits), fructose being one of them.

Super Sweet Alternative to Shakeology,"I bought this as an alternative to Shakeology because Shakeology is too expensive! I was looking for a comparable protein powder that also included nutritional supplements. The Nature's Bounty is actually very comparable to the nutritional content of Shakeology, and even has a higher percentage DV of many of the nutrients than Shakeology. However, this is SO SWEET, much sweeter than Shakeology, which is surprising because it actually has less sugar. I guess the additional ingredients in Shakeology really mute the sweetness of the product. This is so sweet that it was difficult for me to finish one shake. I drink one for breakfast with yogurt, fruit, and almond milk and I just can't handle that much sweetness in the morning. It tastes like a cake batter milkshake! If that's what you're looking for, then this product is great, but it is not what I'm looking for in terms of a protein and nutritional supplement. I will not purchase again, I don't even think I will finish the container.

Not a fan...,"I tried the protein powder for 3 consecutive months until I decided to shop around for another type of protein. I was new to the world of protein powder, and with all the possible options I chose this one because of all the other benefits it includes (fiber, biotin, lots of vitamins, etc). This is why I continued to purchase the product although I was starting to dislike it. These are the things I did not like about it. 1. the taste is awful without milk... 2. it NEVER really dissolves (even if you blend it), so it has a chalky feel to it. 3. it has a really thick consistency when you add milk to it, so you better have water near by. It's like drinking watered-down pancake batter. And lastly, even though 2 scoops of protein powder contain 30+ grams of protein, this wouldn't be able to hold me over for 2 hours. And its not that I have a big appetite, because I can eat two eggs and not have to eat for over 5 hours. Its just that it is very easy for my stomach to digest this (it's isolate...).

Its Ok,"Decent shake powder. Tastes A tad chalky but not overly horrible. Made it first with vanilla almond milk before work and it almost solidified in about 2 hours.

I find i need to mix with more water than called for to make most shakes edible, so i mixed the amount of scoops directed with 14 oz water instead of 8. Not impressed but don't want a refund. Hoping the vanilla that's going to be delivered today is better.

Amazon switched to this from other Subscriber Product,"I bought this and SlimFast as a vitamin supplement, not to lose weight. Three issues (in order of importance):

1. The taste - Leaves behind that overbearing nutri-sweet aftertaste. Very noticeable 10 minutes after you drink it. And the chocolate taste is anemic. It tastes like a vitamin supplement.
2. Mixing - Does not mix well, with pockets of powder that float about and burst when you drink it. I use a blender as well.
3. The packaging - The jar plastic coat which is also the product label is used to seal the top of the lid to the jar. One piece. When you remove it to open the jar, there is no perforation which means if you are not careful (and I was, with a blade) you lose the label and are left with a plain white jar, no label, if you just pull it off.

The flavor is nasty and does not blend well. It is still a bit chalky after blending. I've tried mixing it and getting creative but nope. Not a fan. I feel like I'm choking down bad tasting medicine. Again, there are many great reviews and this is just my opinion. I personally love vanilla but I don't love this. I will not be buying again.

Intially loved; migraines,"I put four stars on flavor because it's really good but different, on ingredient quality because I'm pretty sure it's good but not really big on knowing what's good or bad I just got it because of the overall ratings, and blending power because I have a shaker cup with the ball in it but I still taste some powder texture.

UPDATED REVIEW : BEWARE of Unhealthy ingredients,"This is an update from my first review. While it still tastes good, it has a lot of ingredients that I consider unhealthy and actively avoid in my diet: soy, maltodextrin, fructose... yikes. Sorry, have to say no to this!

I was not expecting much from this product, but had it this morning with almond milk and fat free yogurt, which is usually too tangy.

Tough to Drink,"This stuff is tough to drink, y'all -- I'm not sure if there's a nicer way to put it. I wanted a healthier meal-replacement before bed, which is when I typically snack too much, but I didn't want to drink a high calorie protein shake, so I purchased this. Gosh, it is so chalky and tastes worse than your typical protein shake (and those are rarely delicious); I have to down it before my taste buds catch up with me. ""Decadent"" is not an accurate description of this stuff, so don't buy this expecting a milkshake or anything like that. I have tried mixing it with both water (gross) and milk (slightly less gross but still on the gross spectrum).

"Comparison review - Advocare, Nature's Bounty, Natures Way Reset","I have tried a lot of the various protein shakes of late, most brands at least 10 times... out of the three listed above, Nature's Bounty is easily third place in taste, in my opinion. It is grainy and you can 'taste' the protein/whey more than the others. Advocare is quite expensive per shake ($50 or so per 14 drinks), but I believe it tastes the best by a long shot. Natures Way has some really dumb packaging (it is a huge tub, but arrives half full once you open it) but is probably best cost/taste ratio in my opinion.

I'm assuming that all these shakes are fairly similar in content/effect, though that's obviously not the case - I just don't have enough nutritional background to make an intelligent comparison, but they all look similar in terms of protein content, calories per serving, minerals, vitamins, amino acids, etc.",14-Mar-13,urbanfarmhouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2TF2R53GOLOB7X5AZNHN72QDGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,1,2 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}

didnt like the aftertaste,"I hate to leave bad reviews, but this is my honest experience. I was excited to try this nature's bounty due to the hight reviews and quality ingredients. Well one day as i waited for my product i stopped by albersons and thought of buying a protein shake to use while i wait for this one, because I am a lot like a little kid, i get too excited and I cant wait. So that might of been a mistake as far as this particular brand and the desire to fall in love with it. I ended up buying slim fast creamy milk chocolate for 10.00 well in the morning I woke excited to try my shake I put in 8oz of almond milk, one banana, one scoop of slim fast shake and two handfuls of ice. I mixed it well for a few minutes served OMG for my first shake ever i was IN LOVE. I was so excited made a shake for my roomate and my sister. They also fell in love, then I made a shake for my kids cause they wanted in too, and they LOVED IT DRANKED IT ALL. So long story short we loved the slim fast shake, drank a shake every morning until this order from nature's bounty came in well i was equally excited and I ran to make a shake exactly the same one banana, one scoop 8oz of almond milk, ice. I tasted it it tasted almost the same yay....NOT it ended up having a after taste. A horrible aftertaste Im not gonna lie it took about 12 hours for the taste of 3 sips of this shake to go away. I was disgusted. I came home later on and told my roomate and sister how I felt about the shake I made them one to see if it was just me. and they did not finish it either! they also felt disgusted by the after taste. So pretty much we used two scoops of the shake and since i bought it weeks ago no one has used it, but we have been buying slim fast almost weekly because its 3 of us here. If my review pulls you towards buying slim fast dont buy here on amazon buy at stores its a lot cheaper you will pay 10 to a little under ten dollars for it here online i believe i saw it for 20 and over.. umm no thanks. Also I had to cancel my subscription with natures bounty protein shake. too bad i didnt like it because Im a big fan of amazon I have many items on subscription and i kid you not I receive at least a package every single day at my house from amazon. and slim fast will not be bought on amazon from this household. So I guess Im trying to say if you really want to try this shake you're probably better off waiting patiently for it vs running to store to find a duplicate because you might be disappointed. Slim fast gained themselves a new fan. and It really has helped me SLIM FAST.. lol I had to, i have been replacing my breakfast with a shake. just breakfast though I love food too much.

GOOD Product BUT VERY HUGE PRICE INCREASE!!,"I took them from 5 starts to 1 because it went up AGAIN. Hopefully that gets noticed and if they get enough of this sort of reaction from buyers, they will make the price reasonable again. Shame on them for increasing it almost $10 a jar.

I have used Publix Greenwise powder for a long time, daily. I was very upset to see that they raised the price on it and not just by a dollar or two. (Now this company is doing the same thing). I looked back and seen that I bought this a long time ago, so decided to give it another try.

It tastes good (better with some frozen banana) and its nutrition content is very close to the Greenwise content (25mg cholesterol - didnt want that any higher, so Pure Protein brand was out although priced better) and low sugar. It has more fiber and has collagen, which Greenwise didnt have, so that is a plus. The Greenwise tastes just a little better, and this is a little gritter but the frozen banana fixes all that. I now mix in a tablespoon or two of Nutvia hemp protien vanilla. the product itself is 5 stars but the price is insane now. Bad reviews due to price might get the distributors attention.

THE PRICE NEEDS TO GO BACK DOWN, otherwise i will just buy the Greenwise locally.",07-Jul-22,JMS609,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5VON73ONI2NJVN4HVLQVXTBFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,5,1 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'Decadent chocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
Wrong Item Again,"Updated: June 13: Same thing happened. I received plain vanilla INSTEAD of VANILLA BEAN flavor. Picture clearly shows vanilla bean - and reason why I bought this.
There are 2 types of Nature���s Bounty Vanilla protein powder being sold. Prices and descriptions are different.
What I received isn���t what I thought I was buying by it���s description and image. Bought it somewhere else last time and GOT VANILLA BEAN not this plain vanilla flavor. This an end for my purchase of this product on Amazon. Highly disappointed.

Updated: Nov. 2022: Picture shows vanilla bean flavor but you���ll receive plain vanilla.

Updated review: I notice the price has increased by almost $3.00. Also, my powder is almost gone and it���s not even two weeks. Ordered my last container and will be moving on to something else that contains more whey protein. I bought this mainly for the added nutrients and vitamins to supplement my small meals. Been using this powder for several months and really didn���t feel more energized except after the first few drinks. Maybe it���s more effective when you���re on the go and have no time to eat a good meal.

This protein powder will be costly to continue using and requiring two scoops drinking twice a day. It���s not even 2 weeks and almost gone. Tried many different protein powders and I must say this one is my favorite. However, need to look elsewhere for a cheaper cost.

Bought this product because of the many high reviews. I don���t regret it. In fact, I plan to order chocolate. I made a 16oz. serving and added two and a half scoops of the powder with half milk and half water. Blended well with my shaker cup without clumps. The taste is quite good, easy to take down. It gave me a little morning boost.

Nasty,"I have been drinking Quest shakes because I was having some low blood sugar issues from my 1200 cal diet and the nurse practitioner suggested drinking a protein drink with casein to cut down my symptoms that tend to come in the morning when I have fasted all night. I like the Quest but was looking for a vanilla powder to mix with my 1% milk and Quest powder was only available in a big container which would take me forever to use up (and it is $40). I bought this product because of the reviews which were really mostly positive. I find this stuff nasty. I do not like the artificial sweet taste, I don't like the gritty texture (even after I dissolved the powder). I only used 1 scoop, thank goodness I did not go with the two scoops. I hate it that I have spent nearly $20 on this stuff. It is like throwing $20 away. Live and learn.

I should really start designing protein drinks for people with tastebuds.,"I just realized I've had this product too long to return it. I have no idea how all these reviewers think this is a good product. I took a glass and tried it with water first....bitter. Then almond milk. Still bitter. Mixed in a blender with banana, ice, almond milk and still yuck. All I could taste was the chemical flavor of some ingredient that is probably sourced from overseas without any regulation. That's bad. I've also read many reviews about people having a bad skin reaction, not just to this protein shake, but another product by Nature's Bountry (hair skin & nails gummies) which I currently take. I'm thinking about ditching the company altogether and going with Hum or Olly. The price point in this explains why it tastes like it does. Think of how much an actual meal costs, divide that in half and that's around how much you should pay per serving for a real meal replacement. Shakeology tastes the best out of everything I've tried, but it's for rich people. I wish someone would come up with something really delicious and fairly priced, but this industry is jacked up.

Maybe I'll design something.... :/",07-Nov-17,Coach Stu and Jacq,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTU5SW5EBPJV536SSPYQFO5UFQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE,the United States,0,0,2,1 out of 5 stars,{'Flavor Name': 'ChocolateSize: 1 Pound (Pack of 1)'}
I started with Isagenix and they taste exceptionally good so I guess I'm spoiled,"I ordered this to see if I could find something comparable to the Isagenix shake products that was also less expensive. The main reason why I will not buy this again is the taste. The lackluster chocolate flavor is overpowered by the excessive Stevia taste. I just can't get past it. I have tried it with just water and also with Almond milk. Even with milk, I expect the same result with the less-than-desirable dominant Stevia flavor. When comparing ingredients to the Isageneix products, it just doesn't match up on many accounts. Although it may be cheaper it just doesn't have the flavor or nutrient load that the Isagenix products contains. If this was your first experience with a meal replacement shake, you might think this is how all of these products taste. I started with Isagenix and they taste exceptionally good so I guess I'm spoiled. This confirmed that the extra $10 per canister IS worth it because 1) I enjoy and look forward to them and 2) will stick with it long term. There is no way that I could stick with this long term.

Contains vitamin D2 not D3...,"I'm not a doctor, just someone who does a lot of research on health. I believe there is a reason why the ""supplement facts"" are buried behind the first 7 pictures of this item that come up without having to click the ""+3"". My fault for not doing more research also. My issue is vitamin D. There are two types: D2--Ergocalciferol and D3--Cholecalciferol. This product contains Ergocalciferol (D2). I know I can't link to any page here, however, it's easy to do the research to find many studies proving that D2 is far less effective than D3. The Vitamin D Council did an alarming study regarding the difference between D2 that doctors are/were prescribing and D3, which can be purchased over the counter. I don't like to write negative reviews for a few reasons, but in this case I don't want to see people hurt. I have to assume that some (including me prior to research) people look and see 200% RDA of vitamin D and believe they are covered.

I'm not sure who might be giving people incentives to write good reviews about the taste of this stuff, but WOW, is it AWFUL! I tried 2 sips of the chocolate and literally poured the whole shake out. This shake mix is LOADED with artificial sweetener and the taste is literally the worst shake I've ever tried. EVER. I honestly can't believe people like this stuff. I'm not that picky about shakes, I realize they aren't meant to taste like chocolate milk if you want any kind of nutrition or vitamins/protein, but this stuff literally tastes like opening a packet of Splenda and pouring it directly in your mouth. Look elsewhere if you want something you can swallow. They also charge you to send it back, $6 or more, so you can't get a full refund when you try this and hate it.

"I had high hopes, but so far I'm really dissapointed with this purchase.","I just got my order today; I was looking forward to trying it out. I mixed it up with the amount of requisite water with 2 scoops, I shook it up, in my shake mixer cup that has worked with the other shakes I have tried with no issue, I went to taste it ��� and it was just bland. It tasted like I hadn���t put enough of the powder in it, though I put in 2 scoops. I added another to see what it would do to the flavor, but it didn���t help at all.
I ordered the chocolate, I figured it would at least taste chocolate-ish, but it only smells that way.

Allergic reaction + intense birthday cake flavor,"Flavor is very intense, like the sugariest, tooth-rotting birthday cake you can imagine, very gritty and does not blend smooth.

Dont waste your money,Absolutely awful. I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews and seeing how much cheaper it was compared to other meal replacement shakes.

Not good.,"I did not like this at all. A lot of the reviews on here say that this tastes pretty good, but I have to disagree. I can taste the artificial sugar.

terrible taste,I have tried several protein shakes and I have never had one that tasted this bad. I could not get it to mix properly and ended up with huge chunks of goop.

Horrible,"Wow did this taste horrible. I read the reviews....most of them good so I went for it. Someone mentioned how it tasted like a chocolate shake. Wow, was that wrong.

Nasty aftertaste.!,I am on a mission to find a protein powder that I actually don't mind drinking.this is not it. It has a very very nasty aftertaste. Almost like aspartame or artificial sweeteners. But it's super strong. I usually go with unflavored but I got the wrong one. Unflavored is very hard to find. I wish I wouldn't have stumbled across this one.
