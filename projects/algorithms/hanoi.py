Towers of hanoi:
n == 1: Move the one disc to the target rod:
n == 2: Move the top to Auxillary and the bottom to the target and then send the auxiallary disk to target.
n == 3: Treat the top 2 as one disc and the bottom as another, in the top 2 
treat as if they only exist and making sure both of them end up at  the same auxillary rod
n == 4: The top 3 as one unit and the bottom as another now treat the auxilary as the target and send the top 3 there
