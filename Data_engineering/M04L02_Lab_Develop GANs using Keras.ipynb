Quantitative Assessment: Metrics\n","\n","While visual inspection provides an intuitive understanding of the GAN’s performance, it can be subjective. To objectively evaluate GAN performance, you can use quantitative metrics such as:\n","\n","- **Inception Score (IS)**: This score measures both the quality and diversity of generated images by using a pre-trained classifier (such as Inception-v3) to predict the class of each image. A higher score indicates that the images are both high-quality and diverse.

A lower FID score indicates that the generated images are more similar to real images. FID is commonly used and considered a reliable metric for evaluating GAN performance.\n","\n","- **Discriminator Accuracy**: During training, if the discriminator's accuracy is around 50%, it suggests that the generator is producing realistic images that are hard to distinguish from real ones.
