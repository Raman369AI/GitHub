<h3> End-to-End Predictive Modeling for Mushroom Toxicity Classification </h3>
<a href = "https://github.com/Raman369AI/GitHub/tree/master/poisnous_mushrooms">Link to project</a>
<ul>
    <li>Objective: Developed a comprehensive, end-to-end solution to identify toxic mushroom species.</li> 
    <li>Process: Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).<br /> Built and fine
        tuned an ensemble model using LightGBM, achieving a 98% AUC. </li>
    <li>Deployment: Developed and deployed a FastAPI-based web service on Azure App Service with Docker for 
        scalability, incorporating a Streamlit app for real-time classifications. </li>
    <li>Tech Stack: LightGBM, FastAPI, Azure App Service, Docker, Streamlit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis and Summarization of Amazon Reviews </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Objective: summarize customer insights from product reviews, reproduce the Amazon summary using other NLP 
        techniques and compare the same. </li> 
    <li>Summarization: Utilized BART transformer model to generate concise summaries, capturing core sentiments and 
        themes across reviews.  </li>
    <li>Tech Stack: BART, NLP, Transformers, Sentiment Analysis (RNN, LSTM), TextBlob, NLTK. </li>
